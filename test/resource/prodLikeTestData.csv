"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sztafeta","Sztafeta","Melchior Wa?kowicz","Modernism","Creative nonfiction","Sztafeta (English: Relay race) is a 1939 book of literary reportage written by Melchior Wa?kowicz. Sztafeta was published in the year of the Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland. Due to popular demand it was reprinted four times already by Biblioteka Polska prior to the outbreak of hostilities. The book was never reprinted in Communist Poland because it praised the democratic achievements of the prewar Second Polish Republic. Sztafeta gives an account of one of the biggest economic projects of the interwar Poland, its Central Industrial Area. The book has been described as a 'colorful reporter's panorama, telling the story of the recovery of the Second Polish Republic'. Ryszard Kapu?ci?ski wrote that Sztafeta 'was the first grand reportage of its kind in Poland's history � written about Polish production effort'. To write the book, Wa?kowicz collected great amount of background information, and carried out dozens of interviews, starting with President of Poland Ignacy Mo?cicki, ending with sailors, coal miners and primary school teachers. The book begins with analysis of the situation of Poland in 1918, right after World War I. The country was in ruins, with two million houses destroyed, with devastated industry, with poverty, hunger and the threat of a cholera epidemic left behind by the partitioning empires. The author goes on to describe the achievements of the Second Polish Republic, writing not only about the Central Industrial Area, but also about the construction of Gdynia seaport, and the political scandals such as annexation of Zaolzie. The book was disliked by some members of the military establishment in Poland in 1939. As they claimed, Wa?kowicz too frequently criticized poverty and backwardness of Poland after a century of foreign occupation.Wa?kowicz, who was one of the first Polish modern-day reporters to write about economy, had authored a series of reports about the Central Industrial Area (or Polish Magnitogorsk, as he called the project). They were published in Polish press in late 1937 and early 1938, and became so popular, that Wa?kowicz decided to gather four of them in one book, titled C.O.P. Ognisko si?y, published in 1938. The book was immediately sold, as Polish readers loved Wa?kowicz's optimism, temperament, national pride and honesty. Impressed by popularity of C.O.P. Ognisko si?y, Wa?kowicz began writing a more extensive work on the Central Industrial Area, and the development of Polish economy as a whole. Sztafeta, with 520 pages, is the result of his work. Mariusz Grabowski of Polska The Times daily wrote in February 2012 that Sztafeta reads like a 'national fairly tale, whose every page is a masterpiece, praising Minister Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski, and the Sanacja government'.Sztafeta, based on the 1939 original copy, together with a number of photographs and maps by prewar graphic designer Mieczys?aw Berman, was republished in February 2012 by the Warsaw publishing house Pr�szy?ski i sp�?ka (whose founder Mieczys?aw Pr�szy?ski is a grandson of Konrad Pr�szy?ski), as the 16th volume of collected works of Melchior Wa?kowicz."

"http://dbpedia.org/resource/In_Cold_Blood","In Cold Blood","Truman Capote","Southern Gothic","Literature","In Cold Blood is a non-fiction book by American author Truman Capote, first published in 1966; it details the 1959 murders of four members of the Herbert Clutter family in the small farming community of Holcomb, Kansas.When Capote learned of the quadruple murder, before the killers were captured, he decided to travel to Kansas and write about the crime. He was accompanied by his childhood friend and fellow author Harper Lee, and together they interviewed local residents and investigators assigned to the case and took thousands of pages of notes. The killers, Richard 'Dick' Hickock and Perry Smith, were arrested six weeks after the murders and later executed by the state of Kansas, and Capote ultimately spent six years working on the book. When finally published, In Cold Blood was an instant success, and today is the second biggest-selling true crime book in publishing history, behind Vincent Bugliosi's 1974 book Helter Skelter about the Manson murders.Some critics consider Capote's work the original non-fiction novel, though other writers had already explored the genre, such as Rodolfo Walsh in Operaci�n Masacre (1957). It has been especially lauded for its eloquent prose, extensive detail, and simultaneous triple narrative, which describes the lives of the murderers, the victims, and other members of the rural community in alternating sequences. The psychologies and backgrounds of Hickock and Smith are given special attention, as well as the complex relationship that existed between them during and after the murders. In Cold Blood is regarded by critics as a pioneering work in the true crime genre, though Capote was disappointed that the book failed to win the Pulitzer Prize. Critics have also noted that parts of the book, including important details, differ from the real events."
