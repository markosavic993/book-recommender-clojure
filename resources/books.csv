"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sztafeta","Sztafeta","Melchior Wa?kowicz","Modernism","Creative nonfiction","Sztafeta (English: Relay race) is a 1939 book of literary reportage written by Melchior Wa?kowicz. Sztafeta was published in the year of the Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland. Due to popular demand it was reprinted four times already by Biblioteka Polska prior to the outbreak of hostilities. The book was never reprinted in Communist Poland because it praised the democratic achievements of the prewar Second Polish Republic. Sztafeta gives an account of one of the biggest economic projects of the interwar Poland, its Central Industrial Area. The book has been described as a 'colorful reporter's panorama, telling the story of the recovery of the Second Polish Republic'. Ryszard Kapu?ci?ski wrote that Sztafeta 'was the first grand reportage of its kind in Poland's history � written about Polish production effort'. To write the book, Wa?kowicz collected great amount of background information, and carried out dozens of interviews, starting with President of Poland Ignacy Mo?cicki, ending with sailors, coal miners and primary school teachers. The book begins with analysis of the situation of Poland in 1918, right after World War I. The country was in ruins, with two million houses destroyed, with devastated industry, with poverty, hunger and the threat of a cholera epidemic left behind by the partitioning empires. The author goes on to describe the achievements of the Second Polish Republic, writing not only about the Central Industrial Area, but also about the construction of Gdynia seaport, and the political scandals such as annexation of Zaolzie. The book was disliked by some members of the military establishment in Poland in 1939. As they claimed, Wa?kowicz too frequently criticized poverty and backwardness of Poland after a century of foreign occupation.Wa?kowicz, who was one of the first Polish modern-day reporters to write about economy, had authored a series of reports about the Central Industrial Area (or Polish Magnitogorsk, as he called the project). They were published in Polish press in late 1937 and early 1938, and became so popular, that Wa?kowicz decided to gather four of them in one book, titled C.O.P. Ognisko si?y, published in 1938. The book was immediately sold, as Polish readers loved Wa?kowicz's optimism, temperament, national pride and honesty. Impressed by popularity of C.O.P. Ognisko si?y, Wa?kowicz began writing a more extensive work on the Central Industrial Area, and the development of Polish economy as a whole. Sztafeta, with 520 pages, is the result of his work. Mariusz Grabowski of Polska The Times daily wrote in February 2012 that Sztafeta reads like a 'national fairly tale, whose every page is a masterpiece, praising Minister Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski, and the Sanacja government'.Sztafeta, based on the 1939 original copy, together with a number of photographs and maps by prewar graphic designer Mieczys?aw Berman, was republished in February 2012 by the Warsaw publishing house Pr�szy?ski i sp�?ka (whose founder Mieczys?aw Pr�szy?ski is a grandson of Konrad Pr�szy?ski), as the 16th volume of collected works of Melchior Wa?kowicz."

He was accompanied by his childhood friend and fellow author Harper Lee, and together they interviewed local residents and investigators assigned to the case and took thousands of pages of notes. The killers, Richard 'Dick' Hickock and Perry Smith, were arrested six weeks after the murders and later executed by the state of Kansas, and Capote ultimately spent six years working on the book. When finally published, In Cold Blood was an instant success, and today is the second biggest-selling true crime book in publishing history, behind Vincent Bugliosi's 1974 book Helter Skelter about the Manson murders.Some critics consider Capote's work the original non-fiction novel, though other writers had already explored the genre, such as Rodolfo Walsh in Operaci�n Masacre (1957). It has been especially lauded for its eloquent prose, extensive detail, and simultaneous triple narrative, which describes the lives of the murderers, the victims, and other members of the rural community in alternating sequences. The psychologies and backgrounds of Hickock and Smith are given special attention, as well as the complex relationship that existed between them during and after the murders. In Cold Blood is regarded by critics as a pioneering work in the true crime genre, though Capote was disappointed that the book failed to win the Pulitzer Prize. Critics have also noted that parts of the book, including important details, differ from the real events."

The novel is the first in a trilogy including Fortuna (1884) and St. Hans Fest (1887).This famous novel is an attack on the Norwegian education system, particularly on the obsession with Latin. A schoolboy, Marius, is tormented throughout the first half of the novel by his scholastic inability, and during his final illness continues to murmur rote phrases, his last words being Mensa rotunda.The main character of the book is Marius's friend Abraham L�vdahl, the son of a respected professor. His mother Wenche is an idealist who struggles in vain to keep her son honest and upright; she takes her own life after falling pregnant to the businessman Michal Mordtmann.In Norwegian, gift can mean both 'poison' and 'married,' making the title of the novel ambiguous. However, the conventional interpretation is that the title means 'poison', as the students are 'poisoned' by rote learning of topics unrelated to real life and societal norms. In both cases, the etymology is the same, namely something that is 'given.' It is the same word as the English word 'gift', adopted from Old Norse."

"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Twentysix_Gasoline_Stations","Twentysix Gasoline Stations","Edward Ruscha","Pop art","Artist's book","Twentysix Gasoline Stations is the first artist's book by the American pop artist Ed Ruscha. Published in April 1963 on his own imprint National Excelsior Press, it is often considered to be the first modern artist's book, and has become famous as a precursor and a major influence on the emerging artist's book culture, especially in America. The book delivers exactly what its title promises, reproducing 26 photographs of gasoline stations next to captions indicating their brand and location. From the first service station, 'Bob's Service' in Los Angeles where Ruscha lived, the book follows a journey back to Oklahoma City where he had grown up and where his mother still lived. The last image is of a Fina gasoline station in Groom, Texas, which Ruscha has suggested should be seen as the beginning of the return journey, 'like a coda'.Originally printed in a numbered edition of 400, a second edition of 500 was published in 1967 and a third of 3000 in 1969. Neither of these later editions was numbered. It has been suggested that these reprints were a deliberate attempt to flood the market in order to maintain the book's status as a cheap, mass-produced commodity. The book originally sold for $3.50. Of the work, Johanna Drucker said:Ruscha's books combined the literalness of early California pop art with a flat-footed photographic aesthetic informed by minimalist notions of repetitive sequence and seriality....Thirty years later, with a quarter of a century of mainstream artworld activity between, the aspect of shock-effect and humor has diminished somewhat. But in 1962 (sic) this work read against the photographic landscape of highly aestheticized image-making."

Chesterton contributed a Prologue, which was written after the novel had been completed.In a literary game of consequences, each author would write one chapter, leaving G.K. Chesterton to write a typically paradoxical prologue and Anthony Berkeley to tie up all the loose ends. In addition, each of the authors provided their own solution in a sealed envelope, all of which appeared at the end of the book.As Sayers explained in the introduction to the book, 'Each writer must construct his instalment with a definite solution in view�that is, he must not introduce new complications merely 'to make it more difficult' ... [E]ach writer was bound to deal faithfully with all the difficulties left for his consideration by his predecessors.'"

The events of the book focus on a claimed war.  Soldiers are told repeatedly 'we have an enemy behind the barrier' and placed in coffin-like modules to be teleported into enemy territory to do battle.However, it turns out that the matter transporter or teleportation system has never actually worked, and the war is a hoax.  The soldiers are wired into a computer prior to their 'teleportation' experience but actually remain in their coffins. They hallucinate battles, with their experiences generated and coordinated by the computer.  The pre-determined fatalities are killed by an enemy energy weapon within the communal reality, as the survivors remember it, but in reality are electrocuted and burned within their coffins.  In some respects, this foreshadows the 1999 film The Matrix.However, Toromon actually does have a real enemy of sorts, on another plane of existence, and at the end of the book there is a cosmic conflict which leads to this entity being prevented from conducting further malicious experiments on Toromon.The stories of the Fall of the Towers trilogy were originally set in the same post-holocaust Earth as Delany's earlier The Jewels of Aptor; however, linking references were removed in later revised editions."

"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aye,_and_Gomorrah,_and_other_stories","Aye, and Gomorrah, and other stories","Samuel R. Delany","New Wave science fiction","Fantasy","Aye, and Gomorrah, and other stories is a collection of stories by American writer Samuel R. Delany, published by Vintage Books in 2003. It is a thematically arranged collection, in the style of James Joyce�s Dubliners (1914), Sherwood Anderson�s Winesburg, Ohio (1919), and Willa Cather�s Youth and the Bright Medusa (1920). The book is closely based on an earlier collection, Driftglass, which first appeared in 1971. The dedication to the two books is similar: one is simply an updated version of the other, dedicating the book to Delany�s immediate family: his maternal grandmother, mother, sister, and father. Both carry identical epigraphs. The ten tales contained in Driftglass are all contained in Aye, and Gomorrah, along with five other stories ('Omegahelm', 'Among the Blobs', 'Tapestry', 'Prismatica', 'Ruins'). The stories consist of ten science fiction tales, in the order the writer wrote them, followed by five fantasies, also in chronological order.When the first collection was put together, Delany and his editor gave serious thought to calling it Aye, and Gomorrah, instead of Driftglass. The title story had won Delany his third Nebula Award � this one for best short story of 1967, so that using it to entitle his first collection would have seemed a reasonable choice. But New American Library, the initial contractors for the book (who had leased it to the Science Fiction Book Club, for a hard cover edition that would appear a year before their paperback), decided they did not want a title that pushed any of the homosexual implications in the stories. Note, nevertheless, that even Driftglass, with its suggestion of wandering, continues the theme of homelessness that the current title and the epigraph suggest. Thus, it is probably not wrong to read Aye, and Gomorrah, and other stories as an ideal version of the older Driftglass.The unifying thematic, suggested by the epigraph, is that it is a book in which the science fiction stories are largely about the problems of people who do not live in the city of their birth�who have all come to where they are from somewhere else. The epigraph � on the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, from a speaker who clearly has great feeling for the destroyed cities � suggests that his home city has been devastated. In some of the tales, such as the opening story in both books, �The Star-Pit,� the narrator�s family and children have been destroyed in a horrific war many years before and many light years away: a war of a sort, which, in the future the story depicts, has become so common that it would seem to be a background reality gotten through for better or for worse by pretty much everyone who currently survives. And the fantasies, such as �Prismatica,� �Dog in a Fisherman�s Net,� and �Ruins� all deal with the possibilities or the wages of journeying from one's home.Only three Delany SF stories are not included in Aye, and Gomorrah. All three are slight enough so that one can understand why Delany might not wish to preserve them: two are collaborations, one with Harlan Ellison (�The Power of the Nail,� contained in Ellison�s collection of collaborations Partners in Wonder); the other is a page-long prose poem, �The Dying Castles,� which appeared in a 1968 issue of the British SF magazine New Worlds (#200), as under the joint authorship of  James Sallis, Samuel R. Delany, and Michael Moorcock. (Several times Delany has said that he has no memory of having written any part of it; and he has assumed the use of his name among the authors was a jape.) The third is a piece only slightly longer called �The Desert of Time,� which was commissioned by Omni Magazine to accompany an illustration in the late 1980s. But other than the stories that comprise his four-volume Return to Nev�r�on series, it is fair to say that Aye and Gomorrah represents the totality of Delany�s SF and fantasy short fiction."

Delany in which he recounts his experiences as growing up a gay African American, as well as some of his time in an interracial and open marriage with Marilyn Hacker.  It describes encounters with Albert Einstein, Bob Dylan, and Stokely Carmichael, a dinner with W. H. Auden, and a phone call to James Baldwin. Hazel Carby called it one of two contemporary autobiographies that are 'absolutely central to any consideration of black manhood' (the other being that of Miles Davis). Among many cultural events of the decade that he witnessed, Delany recounts his attendance at the first New York City performance of artist Allan Kaprow's 18 Happenings in 6 Parts, the 1959 performance piece that, for many, marks the end of modernism and the beginning of postmodernism. In section 17.4 of the University of Minnesota Press edition, he describes the event and its venue, and speculates on its artistic significance. The introduction puts an emphasis on the idea of the unreliable narrator; Delany's accounts often contrast his life as it 'felt' to ways in which it actually occurred."

"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aye,_and_Gomorrah,_and_other_stories","Aye, and Gomorrah, and other stories","Samuel R. Delany","New Wave science fiction","Science fiction","Aye, and Gomorrah, and other stories is a collection of stories by American writer Samuel R. Delany, published by Vintage Books in 2003. It is a thematically arranged collection, in the style of James Joyce�s Dubliners (1914), Sherwood Anderson�s Winesburg, Ohio (1919), and Willa Cather�s Youth and the Bright Medusa (1920). The book is closely based on an earlier collection, Driftglass, which first appeared in 1971. The dedication to the two books is similar: one is simply an updated version of the other, dedicating the book to Delany�s immediate family: his maternal grandmother, mother, sister, and father. Both carry identical epigraphs. The ten tales contained in Driftglass are all contained in Aye, and Gomorrah, along with five other stories ('Omegahelm', 'Among the Blobs', 'Tapestry', 'Prismatica', 'Ruins'). The stories consist of ten science fiction tales, in the order the writer wrote them, followed by five fantasies, also in chronological order.When the first collection was put together, Delany and his editor gave serious thought to calling it Aye, and Gomorrah, instead of Driftglass. The title story had won Delany his third Nebula Award � this one for best short story of 1967, so that using it to entitle his first collection would have seemed a reasonable choice. But New American Library, the initial contractors for the book (who had leased it to the Science Fiction Book Club, for a hard cover edition that would appear a year before their paperback), decided they did not want a title that pushed any of the homosexual implications in the stories. Note, nevertheless, that even Driftglass, with its suggestion of wandering, continues the theme of homelessness that the current title and the epigraph suggest. Thus, it is probably not wrong to read Aye, and Gomorrah, and other stories as an ideal version of the older Driftglass.The unifying thematic, suggested by the epigraph, is that it is a book in which the science fiction stories are largely about the problems of people who do not live in the city of their birth�who have all come to where they are from somewhere else. The epigraph � on the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, from a speaker who clearly has great feeling for the destroyed cities � suggests that his home city has been devastated. In some of the tales, such as the opening story in both books, �The Star-Pit,� the narrator�s family and children have been destroyed in a horrific war many years before and many light years away: a war of a sort, which, in the future the story depicts, has become so common that it would seem to be a background reality gotten through for better or for worse by pretty much everyone who currently survives. And the fantasies, such as �Prismatica,� �Dog in a Fisherman�s Net,� and �Ruins� all deal with the possibilities or the wages of journeying from one's home.Only three Delany SF stories are not included in Aye, and Gomorrah. All three are slight enough so that one can understand why Delany might not wish to preserve them: two are collaborations, one with Harlan Ellison (�The Power of the Nail,� contained in Ellison�s collection of collaborations Partners in Wonder); the other is a page-long prose poem, �The Dying Castles,� which appeared in a 1968 issue of the British SF magazine New Worlds (#200), as under the joint authorship of  James Sallis, Samuel R. Delany, and Michael Moorcock. (Several times Delany has said that he has no memory of having written any part of it; and he has assumed the use of his name among the authors was a jape.) The third is a piece only slightly longer called �The Desert of Time,� which was commissioned by Omni Magazine to accompany an illustration in the late 1980s. But other than the stories that comprise his four-volume Return to Nev�r�on series, it is fair to say that Aye and Gomorrah represents the totality of Delany�s SF and fantasy short fiction."

Virgil's  heightened perceptions as he dies recall his life and the age in which he lives. The poet is in the interval between life and death, just as his culture hangs between the pagan and Christian eras.

It is based upon the biography of a fictional personality called Shyamrav Pethekar, better known as Sikander. The novel is set in Ahmedabad and draws an excellent and realistic portrait of Gujarat underworld, that is unknown in Hindi fiction.There are actually two novels of same nameIn the first version the story starts with Sikander planning to take revenge on a guy called Ratan Shah, who has cheated and killed Sikander's friend Kundan Seth. The trio of Rattan Shah, Kundan Seth and another fellow called Latif Katta kidnapped a rich businessman's nine-year-old daughter for Rs 40 Lakh. The plan was not to kill her but Ratan Shah turned traitor, he killed not only the girl but also Latif Katta and had poor Seth framed for both the murders, with help of a semi-callgirl Rupali, a police inspector called Gokhle and the management and staff of Hotel Surya.(Later instead of killing Rupali Sikander will force her to become his keep, along with her two sisters Malti and Kanchan, and at the end the three sisters will play a vital role in bringing down the Sikander by helping his arch-enemy Chhota Dalvi.)One by one Sikander kills all. As almost all were part of Ahmedabad underworld, the underworld is shaken to its foundations and the ruthless Sikander, whose main area was only Lal Darwaza, becomes more and more powerful as he becomes the monopolist of bootlegging in the city. Bootlegging makes Sikander, who was born in a slum in Surat, a rich man living in a luxury flat. Then one day he makes a mistake, he tells Rupali the story of Samson and Delilah, and also tells her that just like Samson's hair, his weak point is his .38 revolver, a gift from his guru, a ruthless gangster called Commander, who brought up and trained him. One day Rupali vanishes with the gun and all the money. Sikander almost goes mad. He was so attached to his .38 that without it he feels as weak and vulnerable as a baby. His enemies, mainly Chhota Dalvi who is actually behind all mischief Rupali is doing, take advantage of this situation and one by one Sikander starts losing his assets. The government is also trying to trap him just like they trapped Tony Montana in Scarface - by income tax strategy. But Sikander has a simple solution to that - blow up the Income Tax Officer with a bomb ! When the underworld hears that Sikander is planning to blow up an IAS, they strongly suggest him not to do that. A grand meeting is held where all big dons of Gujarat including Firangi, Tony Masalamix and Vijaysingh (based on character of Vijay Mallya) are present to talk to Sikander just like the five 'families' do in end of The Godfather, but Sikander has nor level-headedness nor maturity of Don Corleone - he childishly threatens to kill them all by singing a song ...machinegun uthaaya sabko udaaya... as he loses his temper when they question him about the disappearance of one of his subordinates. This way Sikander signs his own death warrant. In the end his own, most trusted lieutenants kill him (under instruction and pressure of the syndicate's general consensus) ."

The novel is unique in the sense that this is the first time Vimal engages in a crime for his own personal benefit (till now all he did was under threat of other hard-core criminals). Dawarkanath, an aged gambler form Agra, tells him of a great artist, a plastic surgeon called Dr. Earl Slater, who would operate only on wanted Indian criminals (for an amazingly high fee, of course). If Vimal (actual name Sardar Surender Singh Sohal), a wanted criminal in several Indian states and NCR, can get a new face, he can live safe from both the law and its breakers. That's what pulls him in Dwarkanath's amazingly inhuman scheme - it would involve crashing the cash-carrying armoured van 'like a piano accordion' ! along with the driver and security guard. The officer in charge of Ratanakar Steel Mill, whose weak point is his shamelessly materialistic wife, is blackmailed to give-in a very complicated machination, exploiting his love for gambling. The team somehow pulls off the thing but things (as they always happen to poor Vimal) go wrong - Dwarkanath dies of a heart attack, the young and naive Kooka (another cooperator) loses both money and life, the money goes back to where it belongs and Vimal is left with empty pockets, his dream of a new face shattered and a long dark road full of underworld adventures stretching in front of him."

Following closely after Anandamath, Bankim Chandra renewed call for a resurgent India that fights against oppression of the British Empire with strength from within the common people, based on traditional Indian values of austerity, dedication and selflessness. It is another important novel in the history of Bengali and Indian literature. Since it fuelled the patriotic struggle for Indian independence from the British Empire, the novel was banned by the British. The ban was lifted later by the government of India after independence. In this novel, Bankim Chandra reinforced his belief that armed face-to-face conflict with the Royal Army is the only way to win independence.Very importantly, Bankim Chandra saw the struggle being led by a woman, the protagonist, in a time when most women remained behind purdah and did not even show her face to men outside her immediate family. This was a tremendous inspiration to scores of women who gradually came out of their homes and actively joined the independence struggle in the decades to come. Some feminists sees the ending as a disappointment, however, because the protagonist prefers to build her home instead of continuing with the independence movement."

It is widely considered DeLillo's 'breakout' work and brought him to the attention of a much larger audience. Time included the novel in its Time 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005. DeLillo originally wanted to call the book Panasonic, but the Panasonic Corporation objected.White Noise explores several themes that emerged during the mid-to-late twentieth century, e.g., rampant consumerism, media saturation, novelty academic intellectualism, underground conspiracies, the disintegration and reintegration of the family, human-made disasters, and the potentially regenerative nature of human violence. The novel's style is characterized by a heterogeneity that utilizes 'montages of tones, styles, and voices that have the effect of yoking together terror and wild humor as the essential tone of contemporary America.'"

It was first published in the United States in October 1979 by Alfred A. Knopf, and in the United Kingdom in November 1979 by Jonathan Cape. Shikasta is also the name of the fictional planet featured in the novel.Subtitled 'Personal, psychological, historical documents relating to visit by Johor (George Sherban) Emissary (Grade 9) 87th of the Period of the Last Days', Shikasta is the history of the planet Shikasta (Earth) under the influence of three galactic empires, Canopus, Sirius, and their mutual enemy, Puttiora. The book is presented in the form of a series of reports by Canopean emissaries to Shikasta who document the planet's prehistory, its degeneration leading to the 'Century of Destruction' (the 20th century), and the Apocalypse (World War III).Shikasta draws on the Old Testament and is influenced by spiritual and mystical themes in Sufism, an Islamic belief system in which Lessing had taken an interest in the mid-1960s. The book represented a major shift of focus in Lessing's writing, from realism to science fiction, and this disappointed many of her readers. It received mixed reviews from critics. Some were impressed by the scope and vision of the book, with one reviewer calling it 'an audacious and disturbing work from one of the world's great living writers'. Others were critical of the novel's bleakness, that humanity has no free will and that their fate lies in the hands of galactic empires.The story of Shikasta is retold in the third book of the Canopus series, The Sirian Experiments (1980), this time from the point of view of Sirius. Shikasta reappears in the fourth book in the series, The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 (1982), and the Zones, briefly mentioned in Shikasta, are the subject of the second book in the series, The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five (1980)."

The novel depicts a part of Brazil's culture in the late Nineteenth century, represented by a variety of colorful characters living in a single Rio de Janeiro slum. It is written with the intention of belonging to the Realism movement leaning towards Naturalism, much like Flaubert's Madame Bovary.Azevedo's The Slum tells the stories of Portuguese and other European immigrants, mulattos, and former African slaves living and working together in a single community. It explores the author's intensely naturalistic beliefs, having various characters being defined and changed by their environment, race and social position.Examples are: the division between the lackadaisical, yet passionate, mulattos and the hard-working, driven Portuguese immigrants, how the climate and culture of Brazil can slowly transform these immigrants' behavior in atavistic ways.

The novel depicts a part of Brazil's culture in the late Nineteenth century, represented by a variety of colorful characters living in a single Rio de Janeiro slum. It is written with the intention of belonging to the Realism movement leaning towards Naturalism, much like Flaubert's Madame Bovary.Azevedo's The Slum tells the stories of Portuguese and other European immigrants, mulattos, and former African slaves living and working together in a single community. It explores the author's intensely naturalistic beliefs, having various characters being defined and changed by their environment, race and social position.Examples are: the division between the lackadaisical, yet passionate, mulattos and the hard-working, driven Portuguese immigrants, how the climate and culture of Brazil can slowly transform these immigrants' behavior in atavistic ways. In addition the role of women is a key theme, with all female characters in one way or another revealing their purpose in the slum.In 2013 the book became a Musical on Brazilian Broadway starring Gabriel Boni Rodrigues and Rafael Morelli.

It consists of the three previously published books The Education of Oversoul Seven (1973), The Further Education of Oversoul Seven (1979), and Oversoul Seven and the Museum of Time (1984).The Oversoul Seven Trilogy is a work of fiction based on the Seth material. The Seth sessions are a series of trance communications Roberts dictated from 1963 to 1984, which provide an explanation from Seth (a multidimensional being Jane speaks for while in trance) on what it means to be human. For example: 'The personality can dwell, and does dwell, in many worlds at once' (Seth, Session 180, page 212). The Oversoul Seven Trilogy is the culmination of Seth's teachings, distilled into a novelized format to explore his ideas on the nature of consciousness and reality creation.  At the end of book two, the consciousness which is Lydia goes through the process of rebirth to become the consciousness of Tweety. Despite being fascinated by the idea of becoming Tweety, Lydia begs her 'Oversoul' (called Seven) for a teaching that Tweety will remember and be able to draw on and use in the 'real world'. Lydia does not wish to start from scratch and go through what she just experienced again. This time around she would like some guidelines. The result is the bedtime tale for Tweety found on pages 190-192. In this 'tale' are found the concepts and purposes behind the novels."

The hacienda 'El Para�so', owned by Isaacs' family, also figures as an important location throughout the novel; it is currently preserved as a museum.The story narrates the idyllic and tragic love between Mar�a and her cousin Efra�n, both natives of Valle del Cauca.

It was started sometime after 1998, with a first excerpt appearing in 2001.The novel tells the story and concerns of Joseph Skizzen, whose father got the family out of Austria in 1938, pretending to be Jewish, then disappeared in London.  Relocated with his mother and sister to the fictional Woodbine, Ohio, Skizzen grows up to be a thoroughly middling nobody, a low-skilled amateur piano player who finds his niche as a professor of music at a small Bible college, by passing himself off as just the right kind of exotic, specializing in Arnold Schoenberg and atonal music, and successfully lying about his training and credentials.  Isolated, he lives with his mother, his only hobby a fantasy life as the curator of his Inhumanity Museum.

Relocated with his mother and sister to the fictional Woodbine, Ohio, Skizzen grows up to be a thoroughly middling nobody, a low-skilled amateur piano player who finds his niche as a professor of music at a small Bible college, by passing himself off as just the right kind of exotic, specializing in Arnold Schoenberg and atonal music, and successfully lying about his training and credentials.

"http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Feast_of_the_Goat","The Feast of the Goat","Mario Vargas Llosa","Latin American Boom","Dictator novel","The Feast of the Goat (Spanish: La fiesta del chivo, 2000) is a novel by the Peruvian Nobel Prize in Literature laureate Mario Vargas Llosa. The book is set in the Dominican Republic and portrays the assassination of Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo, and its aftermath, from two distinct standpoints a generation apart: during and immediately after the assassination itself, in May 1961; and thirty five years later, in 1996. Throughout, there is also extensive reflection on the heyday of the dictatorship, in the 1950s, and its significance for the island and its inhabitants.The novel follows three interwoven storylines.  The first concerns a woman, Urania Cabral, who is back in the Dominican Republic, after a long absence, to visit her ailing father; she ends up recalling incidents from her youth and recounting a long-held secret to her aunt and cousins. The second story line focuses on the last day in Trujillo's life from the moment he wakes up onwards, and shows us the regime's inner circle, to which Urania's father once belonged. The third strand depicts Trujillo's assassins, many of whom had previously been government loyalists, as they wait for his car late that night; after the assassination, this story line shows us the assassins' persecution. Each aspect of the book's plot reveals a different viewpoint on the Dominican Republic's political and social environment, past and present.  Readers are shown the regime's downward spiral, Trujillo's assassination, and its aftermath through the eyes of insiders, conspirators, and a middle-aged woman looking back. The novel is therefore a kaleidoscopic portrait of dictatorial power, including its psychological effects, and its long-term impact.  The novel's themes include the nature of power and corruption, and their relationship to machismo and sexual perversion in a rigidly hierarchical society with strongly gendered roles. Memory, and the process of remembering, is also an important theme, especially in Urania's narrative as she recalls her youth in the Dominican Republic. Her story (and the book as a whole) ends when she recounts the terrible events that led to her leaving the country at the age of 14. The book itself serves as a reminder of the atrocities of dictatorship, to ensure that the dangers of absolute power will be remembered by a new generation.Vargas Llosa interlaces fictional elements and historical events: the book is not a documentary, and the Cabral family, for instance, is completely fictional.  On the other hand, the characters of Trujillo and Trujillo's assassins are drawn from the historical record; Vargas Llosa weaves real historical incidents of brutality and oppression into these people's stories, to further illuminate the nature of the regime and the responses it provoked.  In Vargas Llosa's words, 'It's a novel, not a history book, so I took many, many liberties. [. . .] I have respected the basic facts, but I have changed and deformed many things in order to make the story more persuasive�and I have not exaggerated.'The Feast of the Goat received largely positive reviews, with several reviewers commenting on the book's depiction of the relationship between sexuality and power, and on the graphic descriptions of violent events.A film version of the novel was released in 2005, starring Isabella Rossellini, Paul Freeman, and Tomas Milian. Jorge Al� Triana and his daughter Veronica Triana wrote a theatrical adaptation in 2003."

"http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Feast_of_the_Goat","The Feast of the Goat","Mario Vargas Llosa","Latin American Boom","Historical fiction","The Feast of the Goat (Spanish: La fiesta del chivo, 2000) is a novel by the Peruvian Nobel Prize in Literature laureate Mario Vargas Llosa. The book is set in the Dominican Republic and portrays the assassination of Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo, and its aftermath, from two distinct standpoints a generation apart: during and immediately after the assassination itself, in May 1961; and thirty five years later, in 1996. Throughout, there is also extensive reflection on the heyday of the dictatorship, in the 1950s, and its significance for the island and its inhabitants.The novel follows three interwoven storylines.  The first concerns a woman, Urania Cabral, who is back in the Dominican Republic, after a long absence, to visit her ailing father; she ends up recalling incidents from her youth and recounting a long-held secret to her aunt and cousins. The second story line focuses on the last day in Trujillo's life from the moment he wakes up onwards, and shows us the regime's inner circle, to which Urania's father once belonged. The third strand depicts Trujillo's assassins, many of whom had previously been government loyalists, as they wait for his car late that night; after the assassination, this story line shows us the assassins' persecution. Each aspect of the book's plot reveals a different viewpoint on the Dominican Republic's political and social environment, past and present.  Readers are shown the regime's downward spiral, Trujillo's assassination, and its aftermath through the eyes of insiders, conspirators, and a middle-aged woman looking back. The novel is therefore a kaleidoscopic portrait of dictatorial power, including its psychological effects, and its long-term impact.  The novel's themes include the nature of power and corruption, and their relationship to machismo and sexual perversion in a rigidly hierarchical society with strongly gendered roles. Memory, and the process of remembering, is also an important theme, especially in Urania's narrative as she recalls her youth in the Dominican Republic. Her story (and the book as a whole) ends when she recounts the terrible events that led to her leaving the country at the age of 14. The book itself serves as a reminder of the atrocities of dictatorship, to ensure that the dangers of absolute power will be remembered by a new generation.Vargas Llosa interlaces fictional elements and historical events: the book is not a documentary, and the Cabral family, for instance, is completely fictional.  On the other hand, the characters of Trujillo and Trujillo's assassins are drawn from the historical record; Vargas Llosa weaves real historical incidents of brutality and oppression into these people's stories, to further illuminate the nature of the regime and the responses it provoked.  In Vargas Llosa's words, 'It's a novel, not a history book, so I took many, many liberties. [. . .] I have respected the basic facts, but I have changed and deformed many things in order to make the story more persuasive�and I have not exaggerated.'The Feast of the Goat received largely positive reviews, with several reviewers commenting on the book's depiction of the relationship between sexuality and power, and on the graphic descriptions of violent events.A film version of the novel was released in 2005, starring Isabella Rossellini, Paul Freeman, and Tomas Milian. Jorge Al� Triana and his daughter Veronica Triana wrote a theatrical adaptation in 2003."
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Dream_of_the_Celt","The Dream of the Celt","Mario Vargas Llosa","Latin American Boom","Historical fiction","The Dream of the Celt (Spanish: El sue�o del celta) is a novel by Mario Vargas Llosa, a Peruvian writer and 2010 Nobel laureate in literature. It portrays the life of Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916), an Anglo-Irish man who became a British diplomat, known for investigating human rights abuses of indigenous peoples in the Congo and the Putumayo District of Peru. He came to support the nationalist cause for Irish independence, soliciting German armed aid against Britain during World War I. The title of the novel is from one of Casement's poems.The novel was presented on November 3, 2010 in a  special ceremony held in the Casa de Am�rica museum and cultural center in Madrid, the same day as it appeared in bookstores. It was a  bestseller in Spain and the most popular title at the XXIV Feria Internacional del Libro de Guadalajara. When the book was first published in Spanish, it was announced that the novel would appear in English in 2012; it was translated by Edith Grossman, who has won major awards for her work.In 2010, the Nobel Prize committee announced Vargas Llosa's selection in the following fashion: '[it is] for his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual's resistance, revolt, and defeat.' This seemed to simultaneously anticipate and chart the author's course in his latest novel, while referring to some of his most acclaimed earlier novels."

The book is divided into 22 chapters, each alternating narratives of Flora Tristan and Paul Gauguin, the grandson she never knew as he was born after she died. Flora Tristan, illegitimate daughter of a wealthy Peruvian man and a French woman, is repelled by sex, detests her husband, and abandons him to then later fight for women's and workers' rights. The story of Paul Gauguin unfolds along a similar quest for an ideal life. Gauguin abandons his wife and children, and job as a stock-broker in Paris, to pursue his passion for painting. In the process he does his best to distances himself from European civilization, fleeing to Tahiti and French Polynesia for inspiration. The contrasts and similarities between two lives attempting to break free from  conventional society present a long, elegant development."

The Right Stuff is based on extensive research by Wolfe, who interviewed test pilots, the astronauts and their wives, among others. The story contrasts the 'Mercury Seven' and their families with test pilots such as Chuck Yeager, who was considered by many contemporaries as the best of them all, but who was never selected as an astronaut.Wolfe wrote that the book was inspired by the desire to find out why the astronauts accepted the danger of space flight. He recounts the enormous risks that test pilots were already taking, and the mental and physical characteristics�the titular 'right stuff'�required for and reinforced by their jobs. Wolfe likens the astronauts to 'single combat warriors' from an earlier era who received the honor and adoration of their people before going forth to fight on their behalf.The 1983 film, The Right Stuff, is adapted from the book."

The Right Stuff is based on extensive research by Wolfe, who interviewed test pilots, the astronauts and their wives, among others. The story contrasts the 'Mercury Seven' and their families with test pilots such as Chuck Yeager, who was considered by many contemporaries as the best of them all, but who was never selected as an astronaut.Wolfe wrote that the book was inspired by the desire to find out why the astronauts accepted the danger of space flight. He recounts the enormous risks that test pilots were already taking, and the mental and physical characteristics�the titular 'right stuff'�required for and reinforced by their jobs. Wolfe likens the astronauts to 'single combat warriors' from an earlier era who received the honor and adoration of their people before going forth to fight on their behalf.The 1983 film, The Right Stuff, is adapted from the book."

Composed over a year's time in 1894�95 and published in 1897, it was the sole historical novel by an author who had earlier disapproved of historical novels on the ground that they inevitably distort history.Pharaoh has been described by Czes?aw Mi?osz as a 'novel on... mechanism[s] of state power and, as such, ... probably unique in world literature of the nineteenth century.... Prus, [in] selecting the reign of 'Pharaoh Ramses XIII' in the eleventh century BCE, sought a perspective that was detached from... pressures of [topicality] and censorship.  Through his analysis of the dynamics of an ancient Egyptian society, he... suggest[s] an archetype of the struggle for power that goes on within any state.'Pharaoh is set in the Egypt of 1087�85 BCE as that country experiences internal stresses and external threats that will culminate in the fall of its Twentieth Dynasty and New Kingdom. The young protagonist Ramses learns that those who would challenge the powers that be are vulnerable to co-option, seduction, subornation, defamation, intimidation and assassination. Perhaps the chief lesson, belatedly absorbed by Ramses as pharaoh, is the importance, to power, of knowledge.Prus' vision of the fall of an ancient civilization derives some of its power from the author's intimate awareness of the final demise of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, a century before the completion of the novel.Preparatory to writing Pharaoh, Prus immersed himself in ancient Egyptian history, geography, customs, religion, art and writings. In the course of telling his story of power, personality, and the fates of nations, he produced a compelling literary depiction of life at every level of ancient Egyptian society. Further, he offers a vision of mankind as rich as Shakespeare's, ranging from the sublime to the quotidian, from the tragic to the comic. The book is written in limpid prose and is imbued with poetry, leavened with humor, graced with moments of transcendent beauty.Pharaoh has been translated into twenty languages and adapted as a 1966 Polish feature film. It is also known to have been Joseph Stalin's favourite book."

Chronologically The Prairie is the fifth and final installment of the Leatherstocking Tales, though it was published before The Pathfinder (1840) and The Deerslayer (1841).

The book frequently references characters and events from the two books previously published in the Leatherstocking Tales as well as the two which Cooper wouldn�t write for more than ten years. Continuity with The Last of the Mohicans is indicated by the appearance of the grandson of Duncan and Alice Heyward, as well as the noble Pawnee chief Hard Heart, whose name is English for the French nickname for the Delaware, le Coeur-dur."

It is the second book of the Leatherstocking Tales pentalogy and the best known to contemporary audiences. The Pathfinder, published 14 years later in 1840, is its sequel. The Last of the Mohicans is set in 1757, during the French and Indian War (the Seven Years' War), when France and Great Britain battled for control of North America. During this war, both the French and the British used Native American allies, but the French were particularly dependent, as they were outnumbered in the Northeast frontier areas by the more numerous British colonists.The novel is primarily set in the upper New York wilderness, detailing the transport of the two daughters of Colonel Munro, Alice and Cora, to a safe destination at Fort William Henry. Among the caravan guarding the women are the frontiersman Natty Bumppo, the Major Duncan Heyward, and the Indians Chingachgook and Uncas, the former of whom is the novel's title character. These characters are sometimes seen as a microcosm of the budding American society, particularly with regards to their racial composition.According to the Encyclopedia of Media and Propaganda in Wartime America, the novel has been one of the 'most popular novels in English' since its publication and it remains 'widely read in American literature courses'.

One of the major themes of Down These Mean Streets centers on Piri Thomas's identity as a dark-complexioned Afro-Latino. Although he is of Puerto Rican and Cuban heritage, the larger American society sees him as an African-American and fails to recognize him as Latino. His own family rejects the African aspect of their Latin-Caribbean ancestry, causing Piri to spend much of his adolescent and early adult life contemplating his racial and ethnic identity.The book was originally published in 1967, and later republished in a special Thirtieth Anniversary Edition in 1997, with a new afterword from the author.

The plot concerns the murder of the lead actor in a production of Macbeth in London, and the novel takes its title from a line in the play.  A number of characters in the book appeared previously in Marsh's novel Death at the Dolphin.  The novel is dedicated to the actors James Laurenson and Helen Thomas who had played Macbeth and Lady Macbeth respectively in the author's 1962 production of the play, which she had previously directed, also for The Canterbury University Players, in 1946.The subject was close to the author's heart. In 1981 she wrote to her close friends Maureen (n�e Rhodes) and John Balfour that the novel had been in her mind for a long time, was 'hell' to write and would, she thought, appeal to theatre people rather than to her usual fans. Her characteristic modesty proved her wrong, as the novel sold extremely well, receiving especially favourable reviews in the US. Her biographer describes the novel as effectively Ngaio Marsh's third production of the play.Like Shakespeare's play, 'Light Thickens' is gory and dramatic, but apart from the traditional murder mystery at its centre, and its clever use of the theatrical superstitions surrounding 'The Scots Play' (a title her publishers favoured at one point), the book describes in absorbing detail the rehearsal, production and run of a 'flawless' production, with the backstage tensions and theatrical detail conveyed with all the author's style, verve and experience. Especially intriguing, among her usual dramatis personae of suspects, including the grandly arrogant leading man and gracious leading lady, are the characters of two actors - Rangi, the young Maori who plays one of the witches, and Gaston Sears, the obsessive fight director who also plays Seyton. Marsh fans enjoy meeting again director Peregrine Jay and his wife Emily (now parents), Jeremy Jones and the management of the Dolphin Theatre from her 1966 'Death at the Dolphin', and observing how the theatre world she describes has changed from her earlier backstage novels of the 1930s-1950s.

On receipt of the manuscript in January 1970, her agent Edmund Cork wrote to her that it was her best novel to date, a verdict with which her American agent agreed. The novel was favourably received by reviewers and sold very well.Apart from the typically unusual and subtle murder mystery, presented within Marsh's characteristic comedy of manners, the novel gives a fine description of Rome's sights, smells and sounds, and of its multi-layered architecture and history, seen from the perspective of an exclusive group of English-speaking tourists. There is also a description of the 1968 student demonstrations, which Marsh herself witnessed briefly in Paris, and maybe this radicalism influenced this book's view of the aristocracy (of whom Marsh has sometimes been accused of a snobbishly uncritical over-fondness).

The episode was directed by Michael Winterbottom and starred Patrick Malahide as Chief Inspector Roderick Alleyn. The title is a pun on the legal term the bar, and the public house in which much of the story takes place. It is set in the late 1930s.Luke Watchman, a top London barrister and King's Counsel dies while on his annual holiday in Devon, after a freak accident in which he was struck in the finger by a dart while taking part in a game with his friends. Examination of the body shows that he died of potassium cyanide poisoning, and traces of cyanide are found on the dart. However, the dart was a new one just out of the packet, and the witnesses all agree that Robert Legge, the man who threw it, had no opportunity to put cyanide on the dart.Alleyn is sent down from London to investigate. He soon deduces that at the heart of the case is a trial which took place nearly ten years before. The two defendants were Lord Bryonie and Montague Thringle, and Watchman had defended Bryonie and put the majority of the blame on Thringle. Analysis of Legge's fingerprints reveals that he is Thringle. Alleyn eventually concludes that it was not the dart that had killed Watchman, but the iodine that had been used to treat the wound shortly afterwards, and that Legge was guilty, because only he could have known that the dart would wound Watchman."

Levi skilfully and lovingly sketches a portrait of the Capital city and of its inhabitants through changing seasons and changing times. The author revels in the riotous celebrations for New Year and the many festivals through the year, and rejoices in the beauty of the city in the early morning mist. He introduces a civil servant who spends his days collecting wild asparagus (a perfect employee who takes up no room in his office and causes no scandals), a peasant who wishes to be a writer, a writer who prefers football to talking about literature and thieves who masquerade as policemen. Rome for Levi is a constant joyous adventure that at every encounter and every street presents the casual stroller with a new and hidden delight.The book has an introduction by Italian critic Giulio Ferroni and quotes as its exergo a sonnet about Rome written by the baroque writer Francisco de Quevedo:Although this volume of essays was published posthumously, edited by Gigliola De Donato and Luisa Montevecchi, Levi himself intended to gather and publish them with the title Roma fuggitiva (Fleeting Rome), a name that had been inspired by the example of the above verses Quevedo dedicated to Rome. 'Roma fuggitiva' is also the title of a short note among Levi's papers, dated 6 March 1963 from the addition or preamble to the article 'Il popolo di Roma' (The People of Rome). From this note, one learns that Levi took that reference as something like a metaphor for the endurance of that which history in any case had condemned to disappear, that is, that provisional 'restoration' that he had witnessed in the wake of the hopes of the Italian Resistance. These are the words of the article:The 'fleeting moment' of Rome in these years is the external and evident history of the Italian ruling class, the fragile immobility of a restoration, the apathetic succession of scandals, speculations, deals, enrichments, the apparent triumph of a clerical bourgeoisie, and, flowing through the ruins, much like the river that so deeply moved the Spanish poet, is a glittering river of cars pounding the ancient roadways.The 1963 note distinguishes, on the one hand, between a Rome that is 'immense and pulpy' and, on the other hand, a 'living precious world', which seems to exist within it, consisting of a 'grey populace' waiting to speak, which is not 'dried out and dead like the stones and the architecture' and which seems to herald a possible world of the future."

The first two editions created an uproar and in less than a year it was banned. A new Spanish edition was allowed in 1946.This novel is fundamental to the generation of 'tremendismo,' which focuses on the treatment of its characters and is marked by extended and frequent violent scenes. In fact, 'La Familia de Pascual Duarte' is the first novel of the 'tremendismo' style of writing. This novel also contains themes of extreme realism and existentialism. The characters live in the margins of society and their lives are submersed in anguish and pain. The archetype of this theme is found in the protagonist of the novel, Pascual Duarte. He has learned that violence is the only way to solve his problems. The novel has various narrators, the main being Pascual Duarte, who recounts his history in a rural dialect. The protagonist is from Extremadura and his life unfolds throughout the years of 1882 and 1937, years in which the social and political structures of Spain were marked by extreme instability. This time is one of the most agitated periods of time under the historic Constitution. The novel has a clear religious theme, partly from the author himself, who was very devoted. The references to God throughout the novel are numerous."

The book is not currently in print.While there were plenty of reviews (Roy S. Simmonds lists 29 in his William March: An Annotated Checklist), many of them were quite negative; most of the negative reviews claimed the book was flat and uninteresting. In The New York Times Book Review, Donald Barr complained that the characters were marionettes; John Betjeman, in the Daily Telegraph, was even more critical: 'The book is written simply, but it is empty, and there is really nothing beyond its simplicity. It is neither real nor fantastic.'Positive appraisal came from, for instance, Charles Poore, in The New York Times, who praises March's 'novel of salt and savor' full of 'quiet, uninsistent irony' and his 'mordant undertones of commentary on what it truly means to be an outcast.'"

It can also be thought of as part of the Creacionismo (Creationism literary movement) along with Pablo Nerudas 'Residencia en la Tierra', C�sar Vallejo's 'Trilcel', and Pablo de Rokha's 'Los gemidos'.The name �altazor� is a combination of the noun 'altura' (�altitude�) and the adjective 'azorado' (�bewildered� or �taken aback�). 'Azorado' has more than one meaning in Spanish and can be interpreted in different ways.The poem is divided in seven 'cantos', ('songs'), preceded by a preface. These cantos were written over an extensive period of time, from 1919 to 1931, and for that reason the topics seem unrelated. The first canto is the longest with almost seven hundred verses, and its content feels metaphysical. In this first canto, the poet introduces himself as 'Altazor'. The second canto, by contrast, is an ode to women, while in cantos III to VII the author plays with and dismantles the language and its expressive limits.A fragment of AltazorThe book includes a Picasso portrait of Huidobro. In honour of Huidobro's work, the poem has been used to name the Chilean Award of the National Arts, known as the Altazor Award."

So as this note indicates, Berryman clearly intended the two books to be read as a single work. In total, the work consists of 385 individual poems.The book is listed on the American Academy of Poets website as one of their Groundbreaking Books of the 20th Century. The Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry editors call The Dream Songs, '[John Berryman's] major work' and they go on to note that '[the poems] form, like his friend Robert Lowell's Notebook, a poetic journal, and represent half phantasmagorically, the changes in Berryman's mood and attitude.'The dream song form consists of three stanzas, divided into six lines per stanza. The poems are in free verse with irregular rhyme schemes. The songs are all numbered but only some of them have individual titles."

These graphs showed a clear correlation with personal characters. For example, for a Komsomol member, the graph is like the Kremlin Wall, that of a 'shagged-out old creep' is like 'a breeze on the river Kama', and Venya's chart simply shows his inability to draw a straight line because of the amount he has drunk. Venichka spends the last of his money on liquor and food for the journey. While on the train, he engages in lengthy monologues about history, philosophy and politics. He also befriends many of his fellow travellers and discusses life in the Soviet Union with them over multiple bottles of alcohol. Eventually Venichka oversleeps his station and wakes up on the train headed back for Moscow. Still drunk, half-conscious and tormented by fantastic visions, he wanders aimlessly the night city streets, happens upon a gang of thugs, and is promptly chased and murdered by them."

It was first published in the United Kingdom by the Collins Crime Club on 6 November 1939 as Ten Little Niggers, after the British blackface song which serves as a major plot point. The U.S. edition was not released until December 1939 with the title changed to the last five words in the original American version of the nursery rhyme: And Then There Were None.In the novel, ten people are lured into coming to an island under different pretexts, e.g. offers of employment or to enjoy a late summer holiday, or to meet with old friends. All have been complicit in the death(s) of other human beings but either escaped justice or committed an act that was not subject to legal sanction. The guests are charged with their respective 'crimes' by a gramophone recording after dinner the first night and informed that they have been brought to the island to pay for their actions. They are the only people on the island, and cannot escape due to the distance from the mainland and the inclement weather, yet gradually all ten are killed in turn, in a manner that seems to parallel the ten deaths in the nursery rhyme. Nobody else seems to be left alive on the island by the time of the apparent last death. A confession, in the form of a postscript to the novel, unveils how the killings took place and who was responsible.It is Christie's best-selling novel with over 100 million copies sold, also making it the world's best-selling mystery, and one of the best-selling books of all time.

An analysis in 1990 was positive about the plot, considered the novel one of the few by Christie that is well-anchored in time and place, a story that knows it describes the end of an era, and mentions that the plot is clever. Christie had not mastered cleverness in her first novel, as 'too many clues tend to cancel each other out'; this was judged a difficulty 'which Conan Doyle never satisfactorily overcame, but which Christie would.'"

In some cases (such as The Nemean Lion) the connection is a highly tenuous one, while in others the choice of case is more or less forced upon Poirot by circumstances. By the end, The Capture of Cerberus has events that correspond with the twelfth labour with almost self-satirical convenience."

Christie, who often admitted that she did not like Poirot (a fact parodied by her recurring novelist character Ariadne Oliver), particularly disliked his appearance in this novel. His late arrival, jarring, given the established atmosphere, led Christie to claim in her Autobiography that she 'ruined [her own novel] by the introduction of Poirot'.Agatha Christie's successful career foresaw  the  use of her eight owned houses as settings for her novels, which were Taken at the Flood, Dead Man's Folly, Five Little Pigs, A Pocket Full of Rye, and Crooked House. However the setting for The Hollow,  (the house, pool, and paths),  was taken from Francis L. Sullivan's house. Francis Loftus Sullivan was an English film and stage actor who portrayed Hercule Poirot in the plays Black Coffee (play) (1930), Peril at End House(1932), and The Witness for the Prosecution (1953), for which he won a Tony Award in 1955."

This approach shows Christie's commitment to experimenting with point of view, famously exemplified by The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.The novel was well-received in the US and the UK when it was published. One reviewer said it was 'a baffler of the first water,' while another remarked on Christie's ingenuity in the plot.

Some of the poems can be taken as comments or epilogues on the short stories (e.g. Gold, Frankincense and Myrrh refers to the gifts in the stable which The Naughty Donkey in the preceding story attempts to eat). Although relatively unknown, this work, when referred to at all, is often stated as being for children; however the stories it contains are firmly aimed at an adult audience and with adult themes, especially for 1965. For instance, in the story The Water Bus, Mrs Hargreaves's cleaner tries to offload her woes to her employer, the main one of which is that her daughter is dying in hospital after an illegal abortion went wrong.Little is known of the reasons for the writing of the contents of this book, however Christie is known to have retained strong religious beliefs throughout her life.

The US Edition retailed at $2.00 and the UK edition at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6).It is the only one of Christie's novels not to be set in the 20th century, and � unusually for her � also features no European characters. Instead, the novel is set in Thebes in 2000 BC, a setting for which Christie gained an appreciation of while working with her archaeologist husband, Sir Max Mallowan in the Middle East. The novel is notable for its very high number of deaths and is comparable to And Then There Were None from this standpoint. It is also the first full-length novel combining historical fiction and the whodunit/detective story, a genre which would later come to be called the historical whodunit.The suggestion to base the story in ancient Egypt came from noted Egyptologist and family friend Stephen Glanville. He also assisted Christie with details of daily household life in Egypt 4000 years ago. In addition he made forceful suggestions to Christie to change the ending of the book. This she did but regretted the fact afterwards, feeling that her (unpublished) ending was better. The novel is based on some real letters, translated by egyptologist Battiscombe Gunn, from the Egyptian Middle Kingdom period from a man called Heqanakhte to his family, complaining about their behaviour and treatment of his concubine.It is one of only four Christie novels to have not received an adaptation of any kind (such as screen, stage or radio) and one of only five of her novels to have not received a screen adaptation - the others being Destination Unknown, Passenger to Frankfurt, Postern of Fate and Crooked House.Christie uses a theme for her chapter titles, as she did for many of her novels, in this case the Egyptian agricultural calendar."

"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Machine_of_Death","Machine of Death","Ryan North","Webcomic","Science fiction","Machine of Death is a 2010 collection of science fiction short stories edited by Ryan North, Matthew Bennardo, and David Malki.All of the stories center around a device which, when provided with a blood sample, can identify the way a person will die.  The machine relays this information by printing a short word or phrase, which serves as the title of each story, on a small card.  The machine is never wrong, but often vague or cryptic.The premise was inspired by an episode of Ryan North's Dinosaur Comics.  The three editors solicited submissions, many of them from novice and unpublished or unknown writers, in early 2007.  After failing to find a publisher willing to accept an anthology containing material by so many unknown authors, the editors self-published the book in late 2010.Shortly after the book's publication, the editors announced 'MOD-Day', encouraging buyers to purchase the book en masse on October 26 in an effort to reach #1 on the bestseller list on Amazon.com.  The effort was successful.  Malki described the feat as the literary equivalent of winning the Super Bowl.  October 26 was also the release date of Broke: The Plan to Restore Our Trust, Truth, and Treasure by conservative Fox News commentator Glenn Beck.  When Beck's book failed to reach #1 on that date, he complained that the anthology was part of a liberal 'culture of death'.In November 2010, the editors released the anthology under a Creative Commons Attribution�Noncommercial�Share Alike 3.0 license. Readings of stories from Machine of Death are currently being released in podcast form on the book's website. They collected submissions for a second volume from May through July 2011."

Initially a play written by Christie in the late 1930s, the plot tells of a daughter's opposition to her mother's plan to remarry.Christie tried to interest Peter Saunders, later the producer of The Mousetrap in the play in 1950. He suggested amendments to update some of the references which were now twenty years old and tried the play out at the Theatre Royal, Bath where it opened on 9 July 1956 and ran for one week and eight performances. It was billed under the Westmacott name but the true identity of the author slipped out resulting in good attendance figures. Saunders however felt it would not survive on the West End and Christie didn't pursue the matter further.Following Christie's death, the copyright for the play was owned by her daughter, Rosalind Hicks, who was unenthusiastic about the play as it was believed that the main character was based on her. Following Hicks' death in 2004, a new production of the play, starring Jenny Seagrove and Honeysuckle Weeks and produced by Bill Kenwright, was to open in London's West End on 14 December 2009. Kenwright described the play as 'brutal and incredibly honest' and 'It's a good enough play to stand up without the Christie brand. It's quite a tough play.

Asimov gives a detailed justification for doing this.Within each category, the plays are arranged chronologically, making allowance for the several not based on actual events. Asimov notes how much is real history, and describes who the original people were, where applicable. He traces those characters who appear in more than one play, and provides maps to explain key geographical elements.Asimov's approach is not popular with some readers' prejudices:'Fans of Asimov's science-fiction generally have little taste for door-stopper books such as Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare or The Shaping of England, and specialists are never happy to see clever outsiders make hay in their fields.'

It was first published in 1848 under the pseudonym Acton Bell. Probably the most shocking of the Bront�s' novels, it had an instant and phenomenal success, but after Anne's death her sister Charlotte prevented its re-publication.The novel is framed as a series of letters from Gilbert Markham to his friend and brother-in-law about the events leading to his meeting his wife.A mysterious young widow arrives at Wildfell Hall, an Elizabethan mansion which has been empty for many years, with her young son and servant. She lives there in strict seclusion under the assumed name Helen Graham and very soon finds herself the victim of local slander. Refusing to believe anything scandalous about her, Gilbert Markham, a young farmer, discovers her dark secrets. In her diary, Helen writes about her husband's physical and moral decline through alcohol, and the world of debauchery and cruelty from which she has fled. This novel of marital betrayal is set within a moral framework tempered by Anne's optimistic belief in universal salvation.The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is mainly considered to be one of the first sustained feminist novels.May Sinclair, in 1913, said that the slamming of Helen's bedroom door against her husband reverberated throughout Victorian England.

It takes place before the actual founding of the Galactic Empire, and even before Trantor has become important.  It starts with a young man attending the University of Earth.  Biron Farrill is the son of the greatest nobleman on the planet Nephelos, one of the Nebula Kingdoms.  The story starts with the news that his father has been caught conspiring against the Tyranni.The Tyranni (who come from planet Tyrann) are a minor empire that rule fifty planets near the Horsehead Nebula.  Tyrann suppressed science and space-navigation training in the Kingdoms, to help maintain control over its subject worlds. The ruler of Tyrann in the story is called the 'Khan'.  Asimov obviously took the Mongol dominion over the Russian principalities as a model, much as he used the declining Roman Empire for his Foundation series.  (See the 'Golden Horde' for the real-world history that Asimov drew upon, and adapted.)The story's in-universe historical context is generally regarded as quite interesting, during the long period between the initial expansion and the rise of the Empire of Trantor.  But the main action in the novel revolves around one small intrigue that really resolves nothing.  It is occasionally considered to be one of Asimov's somewhat lesser novels, and Asimov himself once called it his 'least favorite novel.'

It is part of Asimov's Robot series, which consists of many short stories (collected in I, Robot, The Rest of the Robots, and The Complete Robot) and several novels (The Caves of Steel, The Naked Sun, and The Robots of Dawn).Robots and Empire is part of Asimov's consolidation of his three major series of science fiction stories and novels: his Robot series, his Galactic Empire series and his Foundation series. (Asimov also carried out this unification in his novel Foundation's Edge, and its sequels, thus unifying the three series of fiction into a single future history).In the novel, Asimov depicts the transition from his earlier Milky Way Galaxy, inhabited by both human beings and positronic robots, to his Galactic Empire. The galaxy of his earlier trilogy of Robot novels is dominated by the blended human/robotic societies of the fifty 'Spacer' planets, dispersed over a wide part of the Galaxy. While the Earth is much more populous than all of the Spacer planets combined, its people are looked down upon by the Spacers and treated as second-class citizens. For a long time, the Spacers have forbidden immigration of people from the Earth. But Asimov's later Galactic Empire is populated by many quadrillions of human beings on hundreds of thousands of habitable planets; and by very few robots (such as R. Daneel Olivaw). Even the technology to maintain and upgrade robots exists on only a few out-of-the-way planets. (R. Daneel Olivaw undergoes some of these upgrades, especially to his positronic brain, over a period of more than 10,000 years.)

Dostoyevsky was in financial difficulty because of his extravagant living and his developing gambling addiction; although he had produced some translations of foreign novels, they had little success, and he decided to write a novel of his own to try to raise funds.Inspired by the works of Gogol, Pushkin, and Karamzin, as well as English and French authors, Poor Folk is written in the form of letters between the two main characters, Makar Devushkin and Varvara Dobroselova, who are poor second cousins. The novel showcases the life of poor people, their relationship with rich people, and poverty in general, all common themes of literary naturalism. A deep but odd friendship develops between them until Dobroselova loses her interest in literature, and later in communicating with Devushkin after a rich widower Mr. Bykov proposes to her. Devushkin, a prototype of the clerk found in many works of naturalistic literature at that time, retains his sentimental characteristics; Dobroselova abandons art, while Devushkin cannot live without literature.Contemporary critics lauded Poor Folk for its humanitarian themes. While Vissarion Belinsky dubbed the novel Russia's first 'social novel' and Alexander Herzen called it a major socialist work, other critics detected parody and satire. The novel uses a complicated polyphony of voices from different perspectives and narrators. Initially offered by Dostoyevsky to the liberal-leaning magazine Fatherland Notes, the novel was published in the almanac, St. Petersburg Collection, on January 15, 1846. It became a huge success nationwide. Parts of it were translated into German by Wilhelm Wolfsohn and published in an 1846/1847 magazine. The first English translation was provided by Lena Milman in 1894, with an introduction by George Moore, cover art design by Aubrey Beardsley and publication by London's Mathews and Lane."

It was first published in 1848 under the pseudonym Acton Bell. Probably the most shocking of the Bront�s' novels, it had an instant and phenomenal success, but after Anne's death her sister Charlotte prevented its re-publication.The novel is framed as a series of letters from Gilbert Markham to his friend and brother-in-law about the events leading to his meeting his wife.A mysterious young widow arrives at Wildfell Hall, an Elizabethan mansion which has been empty for many years, with her young son and servant. She lives there in strict seclusion under the assumed name Helen Graham and very soon finds herself the victim of local slander. Refusing to believe anything scandalous about her, Gilbert Markham, a young farmer, discovers her dark secrets. In her diary, Helen writes about her husband's physical and moral decline through alcohol, and the world of debauchery and cruelty from which she has fled. This novel of marital betrayal is set within a moral framework tempered by Anne's optimistic belief in universal salvation.The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is mainly considered to be one of the first sustained feminist novels.May Sinclair, in 1913, said that the slamming of Helen's bedroom door against her husband reverberated throughout Victorian England.  In escaping her husband, Helen violates not only social conventions, but also English law."

The book is a roman � clef, rooted in autobiographical incidents. The story follows its protagonist, Raoul Duke, and his attorney, Dr. Gonzo, as they descend on Las Vegas to chase the American Dream through a drug-induced haze, all the while ruminating on the failure of the 1960s countercultural movement. The work is Thompson's most famous, and is noted for its lurid descriptions of illegal drug use, its early retrospective on the culture of the 1960s, and its popularization of Thompson's highly subjective blend of fact and fiction that has become known as gonzo journalism. The novel first appeared as a two-part series in Rolling Stone magazine in 1971, was published as a book in 1972, and was later adapted into a film of the same name in 1998 by Terry Gilliam, starring Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro who portrayed Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo, respectively."

He sees a piece of exotic jewelry in a museum, and learns that its source is the nearby decrepit seaport of Innsmouth.  He travels to Innsmouth and observes disturbing events and people. A local resident tells him a horrifying story of aquatic monsters who can interbreed with humans to produce amphibian hybrids.  The student is tricked into staying overnight in the town, and he is attacked in his hotel.  He flees, but finds that his pursuers are the hybrid monsters of his informant�s story. He alerts the authorities, who take drastic action.  He then discovers that he has alien ancestors and must eventually return to the sea.It is the only Lovecraft story which was published in book form during his lifetime.According to L Sprague de Camp, Lovecraft distrusted his ability to narrate action, and the story is unusual in that Lovecraft includes in chapter IV a sustained and effective piece of action writing."

It takes place before the actual founding of the Galactic Empire, and even before Trantor has become important.  It starts with a young man attending the University of Earth.  Biron Farrill is the son of the greatest nobleman on the planet Nephelos, one of the Nebula Kingdoms.  The story starts with the news that his father has been caught conspiring against the Tyranni.The Tyranni (who come from planet Tyrann) are a minor empire that rule fifty planets near the Horsehead Nebula.  Tyrann suppressed science and space-navigation training in the Kingdoms, to help maintain control over its subject worlds. The ruler of Tyrann in the story is called the 'Khan'.  Asimov obviously took the Mongol dominion over the Russian principalities as a model, much as he used the declining Roman Empire for his Foundation series.  (See the 'Golden Horde' for the real-world history that Asimov drew upon, and adapted.)The story's in-universe historical context is generally regarded as quite interesting, during the long period between the initial expansion and the rise of the Empire of Trantor.  But the main action in the novel revolves around one small intrigue that really resolves nothing.  It is occasionally considered to be one of Asimov's somewhat lesser novels, and Asimov himself once called it his 'least favorite novel.' The novel was originally serialized as Tyrann, and its first paperback edition was retitled The Rebellious Stars."

The anthology was first published in April 1974.The anthology was inspired by a dream Asimov had on the morning of 3 April 1973. In his dream, Asimov had prepared an anthology of his favorite science fiction stories from the 1930s and was delighted to get a chance to read them again. After waking, he told his fiance� Janet Jeppson about the dream, and she suggested that he actually do such an anthology. Doubleday agreed to publish the anthology, and Asimov's friend Sam Moskowitz provided him with copies of the relevant science fiction magazines. Asimov completed work on the anthology on 10 May.The stories were selected by Asimov, and the main selection criterion was the degree to which they influenced him when he was growing up in the 1930s. The prefatory material and individual introductions to the stories fill in the details about the early life of the child prodigy, which effectively makes the volume an autobiographical prequel to his earlier collection The Early Asimov.The anthology was first published as a large hardcover by Doubleday in 1974 and re-issued as three smaller paperbacks by Fawcett Books the following year. The series was re-issued multiple times in the period of 1975-1984 in sets of either three or four paperbacks. As of 2013, it is out of print."

It is the first installment of the Dune saga, and in 2003 was cited as the world's best-selling science fiction novel.Set in the distant future amidst a feudal interstellar society in which noble houses, in control of individual planets, owe allegiance to the Padishah Emperor, Dune tells the story of young Paul Atreides, whose noble family accepts the stewardship of the desert planet Arrakis. As this planet is the only source of the 'spice' melange, the most important and valuable substance in the universe, control of Arrakis is a coveted � and dangerous � undertaking. The story explores the multi-layered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion, as the forces of the empire confront each other in a struggle for the control of Arrakis and its 'spice'.Herbert wrote five sequels: Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune, and Chapterhouse: Dune. The first novel also inspired a 1984 film adaptation by David Lynch, the 2000 Sci-Fi Channel miniseries Frank Herbert's Dune and its 2003 sequel Frank Herbert's Children of Dune (which combines the events of Dune Messiah and Children of Dune), computer games, at least two board games, songs, and a series of followups, including prequels and sequels, that were co-written by Kevin J.

The edition with annotations is now standard.All of the 1970 book originally appeared as stories in magazines before being collected. There is some debate on whether the book is an experimental novel with chapters or a collection of linked stories. With titles such as 'Plans for the Assassination of Jacqueline Kennedy,' 'Love and Napalm: Export USA,' and 'Why I Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan,' and by constantly associating the Kennedy assassination with a sexual or sporting event, the work has maintained controversy, especially in the United States, where some considered it a slur on the dead president's image.

It was originally serialized in the February, March and April 1936 issues of Astounding Stories.

Throughout the story, Dyer details a series of previously untold events in the hope of deterring another group of explorers who wish to return to the continent. The novella's title is derived from a line in 'The Hashish Man,' a short story by fantasy writer Edward Plunkett, Lord Dunsany: 'And we came at last to those ivory hills that are named the Mountains of Madness...'The story has inadvertently popularized the concept of ancient astronauts, as well as Antarctica�s place in the �ancient astronaut mythology�."

The novel follows Agnes Grey, a governess, as she works within families of the English gentry. Scholarship and comments by Anne's sister Charlotte Bront� suggest the novel is largely based on Anne Bront�'s own experiences as a governess for five years. Like her sister Charlotte's novel Jane Eyre, it addresses what the precarious position of governess entailed and how it affected a young woman.The choice of central character allows Anne to deal with issues of oppression and abuse of women and governesses, isolation and ideas of empathy. An additional theme is the fair treatment of animals. Agnes Grey also mimics some of the stylistic approaches of bildungsromans, employing ideas of personal growth and coming to age, but representing a character who in fact does not gain in virtue.The Irish novelist George Moore praised Agnes Grey as 'the most perfect prose narrative in English letters,' and went so far as to compare Anne's prose to that of Jane Austen. Modern critics have made more subdued claims admiring Agnes Grey with a less overt praise of Bront�'s work than Moore."

Written between October 1845 and June 1846, Wuthering Heights was published in 1847 under the pseudonym 'Ellis Bell'; Bront� died the following year, aged 30. Wuthering Heights and Anne Bront�'s Agnes Grey were accepted by publisher Thomas Newby before the success of their sister Charlotte's novel, Jane Eyre. After Emily's death, Charlotte edited the manuscript of Wuthering Heights, and arranged for the edited version to be published as a posthumous second edition in 1850.Although Wuthering Heights is now widely regarded as a classic of English literature, contemporary reviews for the novel were deeply polarised; it was considered controversial because its depiction of mental and physical cruelty was unusually stark, and it challenged strict Victorian ideals of the day, including religious hypocrisy, morality, social classes and gender inequality. The English poet and painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti referred to it as 'A fiend of a book � an incredible monster ... The action is laid in hell, � only it seems places and people have English names there.'In the second half of the 19th century, Charlotte Bront�'s Jane Eyre was considered the best of the Bront� sisters' works, but following later re-evaluation, critics began to argue that Wuthering Heights was superior. The book has inspired adaptations, including film, radio and television dramatisations, a musical by Bernard J.

In Thirty Years of Arkham House, Derleth implied that this title had sold out by the end of 1944.However, more than twenty years later, in 1967, Derleth listed Someone in the Dark in an Arkham House bulletin with this announcement: 'We have acquired a small stock of this title, Derleth's first collection of macabre tales, published in 1941. They will be sold at $5.00 the copy to patrons interested in acquiring the book...'Derleth was being disingenuous in suggesting these 'unearthed' copies were the 1941 edition.  The additional 300 copies were printed in offset by Hunter Publishing Co. in Winston-Salem, NC in 1965, the reprint probably authorized by Derleth himself.  (In The Arkham House Companion, Sheldon Jaffery quotes a letter that seems to indicate this). The 1965 reprint are a quarter-inch higher than the originals, and are bound with headbands (not present in the 1941 first editions).  The 1965 edition is scarce. While it is not generally considered an official Arkham House publication, it is considered an essential acquisition for Arkham House completists. A paperback reprint was issued by Jove Books in 1978."

"http://dbpedia.org/resource/I,_Robot","I, Robot","Isaac Asimov","Golden Age of Science Fiction","Science fiction","I, Robot is a collection of nine science fiction short stories by Isaac Asimov.   The stories originally appeared in the American magazines Super Science Stories and Astounding Science Fiction between 1940 and 1950 and were then compiled into a book for stand-alone publication by Gnome Press in 1950, in an initial edition of 5,000 copies.  The stories are woven together by a framing narrative in which the fictional Dr. Susan Calvin tells each story to a reporter (who serves as the narrator) in the 21st century.  Although the stories can be read separately, they share a theme of the interaction of humans, robots, and morality, and when combined they tell a larger story of Asimov's fictional history of robotics.Several of the stories feature the character of Dr. Calvin, chief robopsychologist at U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men, Inc., the major manufacturer of robots. Upon their publication in this collection, Asimov wrote a framing sequence presenting the stories as Calvin's reminiscences during an interview with her about her life's work, chiefly concerned with aberrant behaviour of robots and the use of 'robopsychology' to sort out what is happening in their positronic brain. The book also contains the short story in which Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics first appear. Other characters that appear in these short stories are Powell and Donovan, a field-testing team which locates flaws in USRMM's prototype models.The collection shares a title with the 1939 short story 'I, Robot' by Eando Binder (pseudonym of Earl and Otto Binder), but is not connected to it. Asimov had wanted to call his collection Mind and Iron, and initially objected when the publisher made the title the same as Binder's.  Isaac Asimov was heavily influenced by the Binder short story. In his introduction to the story in Isaac Asimov Presents the Great SF Stories (1979), Asimov wrote: 'It certainly caught my attention. Two months after I read it, I began 'Robbie', about a sympathetic robot, and that was the start of my positronic robot series. Eleven years later, when nine of my robot stories were collected into a book, the publisher named the collection I, Robot over my objections. My book is now the more famous, but Otto's story was there first.'"

Ishmael narrates the monomaniacal quest of Ahab, captain of the whaler Pequod, for revenge on Moby Dick, a white whale which on a previous voyage destroyed Ahab's ship and severed his leg at the knee. Although the novel was a commercial failure and out of print at the time of the author's death in 1891, its reputation as a Great American Novel grew during the 20th century. William Faulkner confessed he wished he had written it himself, and D. H.

'Call me Ishmael' is one of world literature's most famous opening sentences.The product of a year and a half of writing, the book is dedicated to Nathaniel Hawthorne, 'in token of my admiration for his genius', and draws on Melville's experience at sea, on his reading in whaling literature, and on literary inspirations such as Shakespeare and the Bible. The detailed and realistic descriptions of whale hunting and of extracting whale oil, as well as life aboard ship among a culturally diverse crew, are mixed with exploration of class and social status, good and evil, and the existence of God. In addition to narrative prose, Melville uses styles and literary devices ranging from songs, poetry and catalogs to Shakespearean stage directions, soliloquies and asides.The work was first published as The Whale in London in October 1851 and then under its definitive title Moby-Dick in New York in November. There were hundreds of slight but important differences between the two editions. The London publisher censored or changed sensitive passages and Melville made revisions as well, including the  last-minute change in the title for the New York edition. The whale, however, appears in both editions as 'Moby Dick', with no hyphen. About 3,200 copies were sold during the author's life, earning him a little more than $1,200."

"http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Town_and_the_City","The Town and the City","Jack Kerouac","Beat Generation","Autobiographical novel","The Town and the City is a novel by Jack Kerouac, published by Harcourt Brace in 1950. This was the first major work published by Kerouac, who later became famous for his second novel On the Road (1957). Like all of Jack Kerouac's major works, The Town and the City is essentially an autobiographical novel, though less directly so than most of his other works. The Town and the City was written in a conventional manner over a period of years, and  much more novelistic license was taken with this work than after Kerouac's adoption of quickly written 'spontaneous prose'. The Town and the City was written before Kerouac had developed his own style, and it is heavily influenced by Thomas Wolfe (even down to the title, reminiscent of Wolfe titles such as The Web and the Rock).  The novel is focused on two locations (as suggested by the title): one, the early Beat Generation circle of New York in the late 1940s, the other, the nearly rural small town of Galloway, Massachusetts that the main character comes from, before going off to college on a football scholarship. Galloway represents the town of Lowell, Massachusetts, which the Merrimack river runs through, and where Kerouac was raised. The experiences of the young 'Peter Martin' struggling for success on the high school football team are largely those of Jack Kerouac (he returns to the subject again in his last work Vanity of Duluoz, published in 1968). The 'city' represents a number of figures of the early beat circle: Allen Ginsberg (as Leon Levinsky), Lucien Carr (as Kenneth Wood), William Burroughs (as Will Dennison), Herbert Huncke (as Junky), David Kammerer (as Waldo Meister), Edie Parker (as Judie Smith) and also Joan Vollmer (as Mary Dennison) -- though she essentially has a non-speaking role (however some of her ideas are quoted by the Ginsberg-figure).   Near the end of the novel, the Waldo Meister character dies by falling from the window of Kenneth Wood's apartment (a distant echo of the real event: David Kammerer knifed by Lucien Carr, possibly in self-defense). In the novel the police largely just accept this as a suicide.  A version of the events closer to the truth can be found in Vanity of Duluoz, in which Carr was arrested and eventually accepted a plea of manslaughter and a prison sentence; and Kerouac was arrested and held briefly as an accessory after the fact."

Campbell had said that the science fiction writer could invent 'facts' in his imaginary future that the reader would not know.  Asimov countered that there were rules implicit in the art of writing mysteries, and that the clues could be in the plot, even if they were not obvious, or were deliberately obfuscated.

Thompson","New Journalism","Gonzo journalism","Fear and Loathing: On the Campaign Trail '72 is a collection of articles covering the 1972 presidential campaign written by Hunter S. Thompson and illustrated by Ralph Steadman. The articles were first serialized in Rolling Stone magazine throughout 1972 and later released as a book in early 1973 (San Francisco, CA: Straight Arrow Books, 1973; London: Allison & Busby, 1973).The book focuses almost exclusively on the Democratic Party's primaries and the breakdown of the party as it splits between the different candidates. Of particular focus is the manic maneuvering of the George McGovern campaign during the Miami convention as they sought to ensure the Democratic nomination despite attempts by the Hubert Humphrey campaign and other candidates to block McGovern.Thompson began his coverage of the campaign in December 1971, just as the race toward the primaries was beginning, from a rented apartment in Washington, DC (a situation he compared to 'living in an armed camp, a condition of constant fear'). Over the next 12 months, in voluminous detail, he covered every aspect of the campaign, from the smallest rally to the raucous conventions.Because of the freewheeling nature of the campaign, a first-generation fax machine was procured at great expense by the magazine for Thompson. Dubbing it 'the mojo wire', Thompson used the new technology to extend the writing process precariously close to printing deadlines, often haphazardly sending in notes mere hours before the magazine went to press. Fellow writers and editors would have to assemble the finished product with Thompson over the phone.Like his earlier novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Thompson employed a number of unique literary styles in On the Campaign Trail, including the use of vulgarity and the humorous exaggeration of events. Despite the unconventional style, the book is still considered a hallmark of campaign journalism and helped to launch Thompson's role as a popular political observer."

At the time that many of these reviews were written, he was one of the few people who worked within the genres of science fiction, horror and fantasy to openly criticize some of its most popular works. Highlights include a thorough savaging of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (entitled 'Luke Skywalker is a Nerd and Darth Vader Sucks Runny Eggs'), wherein he describes it as 'shallow' and 'a film without soul, without a core,' and writing that Gremlins 'suffers from the dreaded Jerry Lewis Syndrome: it vacillates between a disingenuous homeliness and an egomaniacal nastiness.'Ellison also used his status within the industry to expose what he felt were unjust handlings of films like Brazil and Dune by their respective studios. He also championed obscure films that he felt were of exemplary quality, like Big Trouble in Little China, which had 'some of the funniest lines spoken by any actor this year to produce a cheerfully blathering live-action cartoon that will give you release from the real pressures of your basically dreary lives' and Joe, which he said was 'a visceral experience on a par with going black-belting with Bruce Lee. Joe will kick the shit out of you. It will set the blood slamming against your cranial walls. It will make you as cold as Ultima Thule.'For a few years after this book was published, Ellison continued to write a film criticism column for The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction but these have yet to be compiled into book form."

"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Angel_Midnight","Old Angel Midnight","Jack Kerouac","Beat Generation","Poetry","Old Angel Midnight is a long narrative poem by American novelist and poet Jack Kerouac. It was culled from five notebooks spanning from 1956 to 1959, while Kerouac was fully absorbed by his studies of Buddhism and Buddhist philosophy. Kerouac initially experimented with Old Angel Midnight (then called 'Lucien Midnight') in 1953 in his diary titled '1953. Notes again.' In entries dated from November 20 to December 3, 1953, he made notes on 'Lucien Midnight' which was to be originally conceptualized in what he called 'book movie' form, when he closed his eyes and projected onto paper a cinematic sense of what he heard. A bookmovie, he explained in Some of the Dharma, is a 'prose concentration camera-eye visions of a definite movie of the mind with fade-ins, pans, close-ups, and fade-outs.' Kerouac's notes on Lucien Midnight were written while staying in the Lower East Side where he initially heard sounds coming through a tenement window from the wash court below. He then heard voices coming from kitchens of the other occupants in nearby apartment buildings and a man named Paddy arriving home drunk, and even a junky stirring in his bed. Kerouac conceptualized an idea of developing a work based on James Joyce�s experimental novel Finnegans Wake (not Ulysses as indicated by Ann Charters in her introduction to Old Angel Midnight for Grey Fox Press) where the �sounds of the universe� became the chief �plot� with all of its associated �neologisms, mental associations, puns and wordmixes� that stewed a plethora of languages and �nonlanguages.� Kerouac determinedly �scribbled out in a strictly intuitional discipline at breakneck speed� the fledgling prose that would finally comprise the finished book for City Lights's Pocket Poet series eight years later. Kerouac's one dogma was to compose Lucien Midnight strictly in pencil by candlelight. Lucien Midnight differs from his sketching method of writing because it is based upon an aural experience, and not visual. The bookmovie approach was abandoned in 1953 in favor of a different approach he had stylistically achieved by 1956.In other notes from the time, Kerouac described Lucien Midnight as a 'monolog of the world.'On March 1, 1957, while staying with William S. Burroughs in Tangiers, Kerouac worked on Lucien Midnight.  Kerouac said of the poem: Kerouac began the first notebook on April 1, 1956. By now his spontaneous prose method had become second nature to him. Kerouac was staying with Gary Snyder in his Mill Valley cabin. Writing John Clellon Holmes on May 21, 1956, Kerouac explained his intentions: �I don�t know what to write anymore, I�ve been doodling with an endless automatic writing piece which raves on and on with no direction and no story and surely that wont do tho I�ll finish it anyway while doing other things.�To Kerouac, Old Angel Midnight was the only �form in which I am allowed to say anything I want because not only I�ve got to approximate the speed and content of mindflow naked word-babble,� but that it could give him to �swim� with absolute freedom, �dedicatedly crazed in the sea of that language.� Within the scope of that work, Kerouac envisioned the voices he heard discussing the �long weekend from Friday afternoon as it moves into Sunday night.� When he prepared drafts for eventual publication, Lucien Carr objected to the use of his first name, telling Kerouac that it was �pejorative.� It should have been, Kerouac explained to Ginsberg in a letter on August 28, 1958, �majorative,� referring to Lucien Midnight's intended all-encompassing universal sweep of humanity and its surrounding cosmos.In December 1958, Kerouac stayed up through the night skimming through the pages of the Holy Bible and an English dictionary looking for a replacement title. When he heard Charles Van Doren, on a morning talk show (the son of Mark Van Doren and notoriously involved in a television quiz show scandal that decade) refer to a phrase from Mark Twain�s journal, Kerouac had his answer. Twain writes, 'I never felt so happy in my life, sir � never since I was born, sir. Loved that hoary, venerable old angel as if he was my father, sir.� Lucien Midnight then became Old Angel Midnight.Kerouac dedicated the poem to Lucien Carr, a friend of Kerouac who was a key member of the early Beat Generation, and whose manner of speech was the initial inspiration for Old Angel Midnight."

The stories, centred on positronic robots, are all part of the Robot series, most of which take place in the Foundation universe. Another collection of short stories about robots, I, Robot, was re-published in the previous year, which is why Asimov chose to title the collection as The Rest of the Robots. None of the short stories in this collection were in I, Robot, however all of them were later included in The Complete Robot, and both novels about Elijah Baley were also published separately.The texts in the collection were grouped into 4 chapters, differentiating their central themes. The first chapter, The Coming of the Robots, included some of Asimov's earliest robot stories, where the Three Laws of Robotics were not yet explicitly defined. The following chapter, The Laws of Robotics, included stories that were written after the explicit formulation of the three laws, however both stories include elements that place them outside the Foundation universe. In the story 'First Law', aliens and direct disobedience of the First Law of Robotics are described, while in the other story, 'Let's Get Together', robots are used as weapons in the Cold War. The story 'Victory Unintentional' in the first chapter also falls outside the Foundation canon, due to the mention of aliens.The third chapter, Susan Calvin includes stories where robopsychologist Dr. Susan Calvin makes an appearance. These four stories are representative of Asimov's robot short stories, following his traditional themes of aversion and distrust of robots by the general public and issues arising from the robots' interpretation of the Three Laws. The final chapter, Lije Baley, consists of the two novels with detective Elijah Baley, whom Asimov affectionately calls Lije.While the original hardcover edition of this book included the two novels, some paperback editions have included only the eight short stories. Some of these shorter paperback editions, but not all, have been called Eight Stories from the Rest of the Robots.In 2002, the story 'Satisfaction Guaranteed' was adapted for the BBC Radio 4 Afternoon Play slot."

They had appeared in various magazines throughout the early 1970s with the exceptions of 'Paulie Charmed the Sleeping Woman' which originally appeared in 1962 and 'Ecowareness' which was previously unpublished.According to the author's introduction, the book was originally conceived in 1970 as a call to action that would contain cautionary tales from Ellison's previous books. Over the ensuing protracted gestation period of four years, however, Harlan Ellison's personal outlook had gradually changed. This resulted in the inclusion of previously uncollected stories with underlying themes of disillusionment and futility in rebelling.  Classic examples along these lines are the dystopian 'Knox' and 'Silent in Gehenna'.  Other notable stories include 'One Life, Furnished in Early Poverty' which depicts a man meeting a younger version of himself as a child and finding himself unable to ease the pains of his own childhood.  The encounter begins at Lathrop Grade School in Painesville, Ohio where the author himself attended elementary school and experienced many emotionally painful and physically brutal encounters with antisemitic prejudice recounted in the introduction.The foreword by fiction author Michael Crichton paints a picture of Ellison as an energetic, eclectic, uncompromising, and sometimes obstinate individual.

Most of the stories were written while Ellison was a draftee in the United States army between 1957 and 1959.  These were sold to Rogue Magazine, a pulp fiction magazine of the era.  Other stories in the collection had appeared previously in publications ranging from Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine to a Chicago weekly newspaper.Gentleman Junkie... is different from many of Ellison's subsequent short story collections in that none of the stories are in the speculative fiction genre.  The stories provide social commentary on racial discrimination, bigotry, and other forms of injustice prevalent in United States during the 1950s.  In particular, 'Daniel White for the Greater Good' and 'The Night of Delicate Terrors' depict the plight of African Americans prior to the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Other stories also deal with oppression and injustice.  'Free With This Box' is based on an occurrence in Ellison's childhood and describes abuse of power by police.Dorothy Parker famously gave it a good review, saying Ellison was 'a good, honest, clean writer, putting down what he has seen and known, and no sensationalism about it.'  Ellison has since stated that the positive review from such a prominent literary figure changed his life and gave him a sense of validation as an author."

All of the stories in this collection center around isolation and alienation, and were selected from previous short story collections to fit this theme.The book was dedicated to, among others, four student protesters who were killed in the Kent State shootings of 1970.  This dedication prompted a response from a reader calling the students 'hooligans' who were 'Communist-led radical revolutionaries and anarchists, and deserved to be shot'.  This letter was reprinted in the introduction to Ellison's subsequent 1974 short story collection Approaching Oblivion.  Ellison states that this letter frightened him and was one of the things that led him to change that collection from a call to action to a cry of frustration and disillusionment."

"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Old_Angel_Midnight","Old Angel Midnight","Jack Kerouac","Beat Generation","Beat Generation","Old Angel Midnight is a long narrative poem by American novelist and poet Jack Kerouac. It was culled from five notebooks spanning from 1956 to 1959, while Kerouac was fully absorbed by his studies of Buddhism and Buddhist philosophy. Kerouac initially experimented with Old Angel Midnight (then called 'Lucien Midnight') in 1953 in his diary titled '1953. Notes again.' In entries dated from November 20 to December 3, 1953, he made notes on 'Lucien Midnight' which was to be originally conceptualized in what he called 'book movie' form, when he closed his eyes and projected onto paper a cinematic sense of what he heard. A bookmovie, he explained in Some of the Dharma, is a 'prose concentration camera-eye visions of a definite movie of the mind with fade-ins, pans, close-ups, and fade-outs.' Kerouac's notes on Lucien Midnight were written while staying in the Lower East Side where he initially heard sounds coming through a tenement window from the wash court below. He then heard voices coming from kitchens of the other occupants in nearby apartment buildings and a man named Paddy arriving home drunk, and even a junky stirring in his bed. Kerouac conceptualized an idea of developing a work based on James Joyce�s experimental novel Finnegans Wake (not Ulysses as indicated by Ann Charters in her introduction to Old Angel Midnight for Grey Fox Press) where the �sounds of the universe� became the chief �plot� with all of its associated �neologisms, mental associations, puns and wordmixes� that stewed a plethora of languages and �nonlanguages.� Kerouac determinedly �scribbled out in a strictly intuitional discipline at breakneck speed� the fledgling prose that would finally comprise the finished book for City Lights's Pocket Poet series eight years later. Kerouac's one dogma was to compose Lucien Midnight strictly in pencil by candlelight. Lucien Midnight differs from his sketching method of writing because it is based upon an aural experience, and not visual. The bookmovie approach was abandoned in 1953 in favor of a different approach he had stylistically achieved by 1956.In other notes from the time, Kerouac described Lucien Midnight as a 'monolog of the world.'On March 1, 1957, while staying with William S. Burroughs in Tangiers, Kerouac worked on Lucien Midnight.  Kerouac said of the poem: Kerouac began the first notebook on April 1, 1956. By now his spontaneous prose method had become second nature to him. Kerouac was staying with Gary Snyder in his Mill Valley cabin. Writing John Clellon Holmes on May 21, 1956, Kerouac explained his intentions: �I don�t know what to write anymore, I�ve been doodling with an endless automatic writing piece which raves on and on with no direction and no story and surely that wont do tho I�ll finish it anyway while doing other things.�To Kerouac, Old Angel Midnight was the only �form in which I am allowed to say anything I want because not only I�ve got to approximate the speed and content of mindflow naked word-babble,� but that it could give him to �swim� with absolute freedom, �dedicatedly crazed in the sea of that language.� Within the scope of that work, Kerouac envisioned the voices he heard discussing the �long weekend from Friday afternoon as it moves into Sunday night.� When he prepared drafts for eventual publication, Lucien Carr objected to the use of his first name, telling Kerouac that it was �pejorative.� It should have been, Kerouac explained to Ginsberg in a letter on August 28, 1958, �majorative,� referring to Lucien Midnight's intended all-encompassing universal sweep of humanity and its surrounding cosmos.In December 1958, Kerouac stayed up through the night skimming through the pages of the Holy Bible and an English dictionary looking for a replacement title. When he heard Charles Van Doren, on a morning talk show (the son of Mark Van Doren and notoriously involved in a television quiz show scandal that decade) refer to a phrase from Mark Twain�s journal, Kerouac had his answer. Twain writes, 'I never felt so happy in my life, sir � never since I was born, sir. Loved that hoary, venerable old angel as if he was my father, sir.� Lucien Midnight then became Old Angel Midnight.Kerouac dedicated the poem to Lucien Carr, a friend of Kerouac who was a key member of the early Beat Generation, and whose manner of speech was the initial inspiration for Old Angel Midnight."

Each story is set at a club known as the Union Club, in which a conversation between three members prompts a fourth member, Griswold, to tell about a mystery he has solved.  These are often tall stories, and often based on his time in US intelligence.  The format is based on that utilized by P. G. Wodehouse in recounting his golf stories.According to reviewer John H. Jenkins, these stories are not rated particularly well by Asimov fans, and are less well regarded than his better known Black Widowers mysteries. He does regard a few of them more highly, particularly 'No Refuge Could Save' and 'Hide and Seek,' but feels the brevity and format of the stories allows the author little scope. It is also open to question whether they are supposed to be serious mysteries or tall stories.Asimov wrote a total of 55 Union Club stories. As well as the 30 in this book, three more were collected in The Best Mysteries of Isaac Asimov (Doubleday, 1986). The other 22 have never been collected in any of Asimov's books.

The narrative follows the progress of twenty-year-old Jenny Bunn, who has moved from her family home in the North of England to a small town not far from London to teach primary school children. Jenny is a 'traditional' Northern working-class girl whose dusky beauty strikes people as being at odds with the old-fashioned values she has gained from her upbringing, not least the conviction of 'no sex before marriage'. A central thread of the  novel concerns the frustrations of the morally dubious Patrick Standish, a 30-year-old teacher at the local grammar school/public school and his attempts to, by hook or by crook, accomplish the seduction of Jenny; all this against a backdrop of Jenny's new teaching job and Patrick's work activities and his leisure time with flatmate and colleague Graham and their new acquaintance, the well-off and somewhat older man-about-town Julian Ormerod."

"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Colonel_Sun","Colonel Sun","Kingsley Amis","Angry young men","Spy fiction","Colonel Sun is a novel by Kingsley Amis published by Jonathan Cape on 28 March 1968 under the pseudonym 'Robert Markham'. Colonel Sun is the first James Bond continuation novel published after Ian Fleming's 1964 death. Before writing the novel, Amis wrote two other Bond related works, the literary study The James Bond Dossier and the humorous The Book of Bond. Colonel Sun centres on the fictional British Secret Service operative James Bond and his mission to track down the kidnappers of M, his superior at the Secret Service. During the mission he discovers a communist Chinese plot to cause an international incident. Bond, assisted by a Greek spy working for the Russians, finds M on a small Aegean island, rescues him and kills the two main plotters: Colonel Sun Liang-tan and a former Nazi commander, Von Richter.Amis drew upon a holiday he had taken in the Greek islands to create a realistic Greek setting and characters. He emphasised political intrigue in the plot more than Fleming had done in the canonical Bond novels, also adding revenge to Bond's motivations by including M's kidnapping. Despite keeping a format and structure similar to Fleming's Bond novels, Colonel Sun was given mixed reviews.Colonel Sun was serialised in the Daily Express newspaper in 1968 and adapted as a comic strip in the same newspaper in 1969�1970. Elements from the story have been used in the Eon Productions Bond series: The 1999 instalment The World Is Not Enough used M's kidnapping, whilst the villain of 2002 film Die Another Day, Colonel Tan-Sun Moon, owes his name to Colonel Sun Liang-tan."

"http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Final_Programme","The Final Programme","Michael Moorcock","New Wave science fiction","List of science fiction novels","The Final Programme is a novel by British science fiction and fantasy writer Michael Moorcock.  Written in 1965 as the underground culture was beginning to emerge, it was not published for several years. Moorcock has stated that publishers at the time considered it was 'too freaky'.It was the first of his iconic Jerry Cornelius series of novels and stories  and was originally published in paperback in the US by Avon Books in 1968 then in London in hardback by Allison & Busby in October 1969. It was made into a 1973 film of the same name (directed by Robert Fuest), but Moorcock was critical of the version released on the screen.Set in a world less abstract and chaotic than depicted in the later volumes, it introduces Jerry Cornelius as a hip superhero and follows his adventures as he attempts to subvert a plot by his disreputable brother Frank and Miss Brunner to build a super computer for nefarious ends. Jerry is sucked into the plans of Miss Brunner to create the perfect being by merging the bodies of Jerry and herself together. When this is done, a radiantly charismatic hermaphroditic being emerges from the machinery. All who see the new creature fall quaking to their knees. As things turn out, Jerry discovers that 'it's a tasty world'.Contrary to the apparent chaos of the later Cornelius novels, The Final Programme is quite structured, being an alternate retelling of major episodes of the saga of Elric of Melnibon�, with the various characters each taking roles similar to those of the earlier stories: Jerry as Elric, Catherine as Cymoril, and Miss Brunner as Stormbringer.The first US edition (1968) of this work was censored. The 1976 US edition of The Final Programme included an introduction by Norman Spinrad. The novel was first published in its revised form in 1979."

The novel is written as Bek's memoir of a dying, demented man, in which he recalls his time with a bi-sexual teenage nymphet girl and how they take refuge in an superior brothel in a German city under siege during a 19th-century war. The standard German spelling of the name in the novel's title is 'Rosenstra�e' (Street of Roses).Unlike the other Bek stories, this novel is not a fantasy. Although it takes place in a fictitious location�the free city of Mirenburg, capital of a similarly fictitious independent state bordering Germany called Waldenstein�it is otherwise realistic in content. Moorcock describes Mirenburg as 'an attempt to produce an ideal middle European city', and it is believed to be based partly on Prague.Moorcock also recorded and released a single called 'Brothel in Rosenstrasse'.

It is the third and final entry in Beckett's 'Trilogy' of novels, which begins with Molloy followed by Malone Dies. It was originally published in French as L'Innommable and later adapted by the author into English. Grove Press published the English edition in 1958.The Unnamable consists entirely of a disjointed monologue from the perspective of an unnamed (presumably unnamable) and immobile protagonist. There is no concrete plot or setting - and whether the other characters ('Mahood' [formerly 'Basil'] and 'Worm') actually exist or whether they are facets of the narrator himself is debatable. The protagonist also claims authorship of the main characters in the two previous novels of the Trilogy and Beckett's earlier novels Murphy, Mercier and Camier, and Watt.  The novel is a mix of recollections and existential musings on the part of its narrator, many of which pertain specifically to the possibility that the narrator is constructed by the language he speaks.  Other 'characters' (a stretch to call them distinctly different to the narrator) serve as the passive recipient of the dialogue and in many places (as the narrator suggests) the dialogue's genesis.  The novel builds in its despairing tone until the ending, which consists mainly of very long run-on sentences. It closes with the phrase 'You must go on, I can't go on, I'll go on,' which was later used as the title of an anthology of Beckett works.Luciano Berio's musical work Sinfonia uses extensive sections of The Unnamable, along with the music of Gustav Mahler and quotes from many other famous compositions for its third movement."

The original manuscripts have been lost, and no copies are known to be extant at this time.Among Dick's numerous lost novels, this one is unique because it represents his earliest full-length literary attempt to blend mainstream literary fiction with science fiction. Up until this time, Dick had written numerous 'straight' (non-SF) novels, all rejected for publication, and had published several science fiction novels and numerous short stories, however he regarded his science fiction as 'merely something to pay the bills,' and kept his genre career separate from his 'grown-up' literary aspiration.

It was written somewhere around 1956 according to one account, or between 1948�50 according to another account. According to Lawrence Sutin's book, Divine Invasions: A Life of Philip K. Dick, the plot survives only as an index card synopsis from the publisher dated 11/08/1956 as follows:'Another rambling, uneven totally murky novel. Man w/psychosis brought on by war thinks he's murdered his wife, flees. Meets 3 eccentrics: an impotent man who refuses to have sex w/his wife, the wife � a beautiful woman who's going to a quack dr. for treatment, an animalistic worker w/ambition but no talent. Man has affair w/wife, is kicked out by husband, tries to help slob. Finally collapses, is sent to hospital, recovers, returns home. BUT WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN?'There is some confusion whether this novel and another early, lost Philip K. Dick manuscript, The Earthshaker are the same book with different titles, a significant rewrite of the earlier book, or completely independent, unrelated stories.According to at least one commentator, Phil said that his later novel Dr. Bloodmoney was to some extent based on a 'Long ago straight novel' that Phil wrote. If Pilgrim on the Hill is this lost 'straight' novel, then its overarching plot may have been superficially similar to the postapocalyptic Dr. Bloodmoney. However, it is equally likely that Earthshaker was the precursor to Bloodmoney, and had a superficially similar plot structure and setting.  Unless one or both manuscripts are rediscovered, this matter seems unlikely to ever be resolved."

The authorship of the work is unknown. There is a general consensus that it was an ensemble effort, but it has often been attributed to Oscar Wilde.  Set in fin-de-si�cle Paris, its concerns are the magnetic attraction and passionate though ultimately tragic affair between a young Frenchman named Camille de Grieux and the Hungarian pianist Ren� Teleny. The novel is one of the earliest pieces of English-language pornography that focuses explicitly and near-exclusively on homosexuality (following The Sins of the Cities of the Plain, published in 1881). Its lush and literate, though variable prose style and the relative complexity and depth of character and plot development share as much with the Aesthetic fiction of the period as with its typical pornography."

The magazine's editor feared the story was indecent, and without Wilde's knowledge, deleted roughly five hundred words before publication. Despite that censorship, The Picture of Dorian Gray offended the moral sensibilities of British book reviewers, some of whom said that Oscar Wilde merited prosecution for violating the laws guarding the public morality. In response, Wilde aggressively defended his novel and art in correspondence with the British press, although he personally made excisions of some of the most controversial material when revising and lengthening the story for book publication the following year.The longer and revised version of The Picture of Dorian Gray published in book form in 1891 featured an aphoristic preface � a defence of the artist's rights and of art for art's sake�based in part on his press defences of the novel the previous year. The content, style, and presentation of the preface made it famous in its own right, as a literary and artistic manifesto. In April 1891, the publishing firm of Ward, Lock and Company, who had distributed the shorter, more inflammatory, magazine version in England the previous year, published the revised version of The Picture of Dorian Gray.The only novel written by Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray exists in several versions: the 1890 magazine edition (in 13 Chapters), with important material deleted before publication by the magazine's editor, J. M. Stoddart; the 'uncensored' version submitted to Lippincott's Monthly Magazine for publication (also in 13 chapters), with all of Wilde's original material intact, first published in 2011 by Harvard University Press; and the 1891 book edition (in 20 Chapters). As literature of the 19th century, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an example of Gothic fiction with strong themes interpreted from the legendary Faust."

The inhabitants of this era are immortal decadents, who create flights of fancy using power rings that draw on energy devised and stored by their ancestors millions of years prior. Time travel is possible, and throughout the series various points in time are visited and revisited. Space travellers are also common, but most residents of the End of Time find leaving the planet distasteful and clich�d. The title of the series is itself taken from a poem by a fictitious 19th Century poet, Ernest Wheldrake, which Mrs. Amelia Underwood quotes in The End of All Songs.  'Ernest Wheldrake' had been a pseudonym used by Algernon Charles Swinburne.The original trilogy (An Alien Heat, The Hollow Lands, and The End of All Songs) was published between 1972 and 1976. The trilogy purports to tell the last love story in human history. Other stories in this sequence include The Transformation of Miss Mavis Ming (also known as A Messiah at the End of Time) which is a rewrite of the novella Constant Fire. Several short stories, some of which were included in the collection Legends from the End of Time, were published in New Worlds 7�10 (the paperback revival of the magazine).

(The 1993 Millennium omnibus edition of Legends from the End of Time ostensibly assembles all the stories and The Transformation of Miss Mavis Ming � under the title Constant Fire � but was affected by severe printing errors and omits the final six lines of Elric at the End of Time and all but the final chapter of Constant Fire.

Zelazny discovered the manuscript in White's home in early 1968, read it, then contacted Dick and agreed to work on it with him. Work proceeded sporadically over several years as each author forgot about it in turn (and Zelazny's cat took the opportunity to urinate on the original manuscript). But they finished it quickly in the spring of 1975 when the publisher demanded the manuscript or repayment of the advance paid to Dick.

McCullough directed the premiere at the New York International Fringe Festival in August 2000.In August 2012 British artists Andy Holden and David Raymond Conroy presented a stage adaptation of the book at the ICA, London, which later toured to Arnolfini, Bristol. The production used a variety of multimedia techniques such as projection of the letter 'Q' on a backdrop that disrupted the monologues and a system of ear-pieces and auto-cues to convey the script to the actors on stage. The adaptation used four of the interviews and one short story and contained new music by the Grubby Mitts.21 of the interviews and stories were adapted and directed by David McGuff for Yellow Lab Productions entitled 'Brief Interviews with Hideous Men.' The production ran three nights, August 28�30, 2014, at the Hill Country Arts Foundation's Point Theater on the Elizabeth Huth Coates indoor stage.Actor John Krasinski of The Office has adapted and directed a film version on the 'Brief Interviews' stories that was released in 2009.

The inhabitants of this era are immortal decadents, who create flights of fancy using power rings that draw on energy devised and stored by their ancestors millions of years prior. Time travel is possible, and throughout the series various points in time are visited and revisited. Space travellers are also common, but most residents of the End of Time find leaving the planet distasteful and clich�d. The title of the series is itself taken from a poem by a fictitious 19th Century poet, Ernest Wheldrake, which Mrs. Amelia Underwood quotes in The End of All Songs.  'Ernest Wheldrake' had been a pseudonym used by Algernon Charles Swinburne.The original trilogy (An Alien Heat, The Hollow Lands, and The End of All Songs) was published between 1972 and 1976. The trilogy purports to tell the last love story in human history. Other stories in this sequence include The Transformation of Miss Mavis Ming (also known as A Messiah at the End of Time) which is a rewrite of the novella Constant Fire. Several short stories, some of which were included in the collection Legends from the End of Time, were published in New Worlds 7�10 (the paperback revival of the magazine). Short stories featuring Elric ('Elric at the End of Time'), and Jerry Cornelius ('The Murderer's Song') also feature characters and places from the End of Time.Main characters in the series include Jherek Carnelian, one of the few humans at the End of Time to have been born naturally, rather than created; Mrs Amelia Underwood, a time traveller from the late 19th century; the enigmatic Lord Jagged; and Miss Mavis Ming in the eponymous The Transformation of Miss Mavis Ming, which also features the Fireclown. (The 1993 Millennium omnibus edition of Legends from the End of Time ostensibly assembles all the stories and The Transformation of Miss Mavis Ming � under the title Constant Fire � but was affected by severe printing errors and omits the final six lines of Elric at the End of Time and all but the final chapter of Constant Fire. These were corrected for the 1997 Orion edition.)"

By the end, he sheds the veneer of civilization and relies on primordial instinct and learned experience to emerge as a leader in the wild.London spent almost a year in the Yukon collecting material for the book. The story was serialized in the Saturday Evening Post in the summer of 1903; it was published a month later in book form. The book�s great popularity and success made a reputation for London.

The central character is a dog named Buck. The story opens at a ranch in the Santa Clara Valley of California when Buck is stolen from his home and sold into service as a sled dog in Alaska. He progressively reverts to a wild state in the harsh climate, where he is forced to fight to dominate other dogs. By the end, he sheds the veneer of civilization and relies on primordial instinct and learned experience to emerge as a leader in the wild.London spent almost a year in the Yukon collecting material for the book. The story was serialized in the Saturday Evening Post in the summer of 1903; it was published a month later in book form. The book�s great popularity and success made a reputation for London. Much of its appeal derives from its simplicity as a tale of survival. As early as 1923, the story was adapted to film, and it has since seen several more cinematic adaptations."

For the American band led by Stephin Merritt, see The Magnetic Fields. Les Champs Magn�tiques  (The Magnetic Fields) is a book by Andr� Breton and Philippe Soupault. It is famed as the first work of literary Surrealism. Published in 1920, the authors used a surrealist automatic writing technique.The book is considered Surrealist, rather than Dadaist, because it attempts to create something new rather than react to an existing work.Les Champs Magnetiques is characterised by rich textured language that often seems to border on the nonsensical. This is considered a 'normal' result of automatic writing and is considerably more logical than the output from other Surrealist techniques, such as 'exquisite corpse' (a method whereby each of a group of collaborators, in sequence, adds words or images to a composition).A typical paragraph in (an English-language version of) Les Champs Magnetiques is:It was the end of sorrow lies. The rail stations were dead, flowing like bees stung from honeysuckle. The people hung back and watched the ocean, animals flew in and out of focus. The time had come. Yet king dogs never grow old � they stay young and fit, and someday they might come to the beach and have a few drinks, a few laughs, and get on with it. But not now. The time had come; we all knew it. But who would go first?The division between chapters was the point where the writers stopped writing at the end of the day. The next chapter was started the following morning.Breton gave many interviews about the creation of the book."

No one actually dies but limbs are broken, jaws shattered, faces are trod on, skulls fractured, ribs broken, and so on. Even buildings do not always survive such an attack. He picks up many injuries himself, but being shot, getting many cuts with Bowie knives, head bashed with numerous objects, having his ear chewed, scratched up by a mountain lion he then threw into a room full of feuding men and such are just minor nuisances to him.He previously rode an old mule called Alexander, the only animal that could carry him till he came across Cap'n Kidd, his equine equivalent, and tamed him.

Written rapidly in the 1960s, it is considered a classic of the genre, and has proven highly influential in shaping subsequent authors' works.A subsequent trilogy, consisting of Count Brass, The Champion of Garathorm and The Quest for Tanelorn expand on the original saga, both deepening its characters (which in the original stories were a bit two-dimensional) and further linking them to the Moorcockian Multiverse.Dorian, in the final pages of the third book, happens to confront (along with other champions like Erekose) the malignant entity which used to reside in Elric's Stormbringer and which broke free at the tragic end of the albino prince's saga.The omnibus has also been published under the title Hawkmoon.Gollancz have announced plans to release all the Hawkmoon stories in both print omnibus and individual ebook form, starting in 2013.

First published in 1970, it is based on stories Moorcock published in Avillion and Science Fantasy. It is the first in a trilogy of books about the Eternal Champion in his incarnation as Erekos�. The sequels are Phoenix in Obsidian (1970), also published as The Silver Warriors, and The Dragon in the Sword (1987).In the book, John Daker is taken from his ordinary life in the modern world and incarnated in the form of Erekos�, a long-dead hero. He learns that he has been summoned to lead the human race in a fight against the alien Eldren, as he once did in the legendary past. He must balance his 20th-century consciousness with his patchy memories of a past life as a sword and sorcery-type warrior. He also must learn to distinguish the truth, since the rules of his new world are not necessarily the rules of Earth, and he cannot decide whether reports of magical events are real.Although it lacks the popularity of other books by Moorcock, especially the Elric series, The Eternal Champion is a key text in the mythology of The Multiverse. Many of Moorcock's fantasy and science fiction works tell the story of an 'Eternal Champion' who is fated to fight for Humanity, or Law, or the Balance. The Eternal Champion introduces two aspects of the Champion: John Daker and Erekos�. John Daker is unique in that he is aware of his other incarnations and his fate. Through his eyes, the reader is able to learn the identities of many aspects of the Champion. Erekos� is one of the most frequently mentioned aspects of the hero in other books by Moorcock. In one story, told from different viewpoints in The Vanishing Tower and The King of the Swords, Elric and Corum meet a third aspect of the hero who joins with them to form The Three Who Are One. When they ask his name, he tells them to call him Erekos�, because it was in that form that he came closest to knowing peace. In other works, however, it is hinted that Erekos� himself committed a crime of betrayal, and that the Eternal Champion is somehow punished for it.The Eternal Champion is the story of that betrayal."

Lock up your daughters, hide your stash, keep to the shadows.'Jerry inhabits a world at war with itself and, armed only with an occasional 'vibragun' appears to fight 'against history' for the freedom of 'randomness' against the straitlaced conventions exemplified by his brother Frank.

The setting of the original story was Irish; presumably it was changed to Derbyshire for the novel because this would appeal more to a British audience.

Scott indicated the plot was based on an actual incident.  The Bride of Lammermoor and A Legend of Montrose were published together as the third of Scott's Tales of My Landlord series. As with all the Waverley Novels, The Bride of Lammermuir was published anonymously. The novel claims that the story was an oral tradition, collected by one 'Peter Pattieson', and subsequently published by 'Jedediah Cleishbotham'. The 1830 'Waverley edition' includes an introduction by Scott, discussing his actual sources. The later edition also changes the date of the events: the first edition sets the story in the 17th century; the 1830 edition sets it in the reign of Queen Anne, after the 1707 Acts of Union which joined Scotland and England.

Although he is the eponymous character, he is not necessarily the hero, as many of the characters around him undergo far more significant journeys or change. Instead, he provides a central figure (and location) for other more exciting characters and events � on which he provides a sardonic commentary. The book is written in the third person so the narrative does not remain with the antiquary.This is Scott's gothic novel, redolent with family secrets, stories of hidden treasure and hopeless love, with a mysterious, handsome, young man, benighted aristocracy and a night-time funeral procession to a ruined abbey. The romance and mystery is counterpoised by some of Scott's more down-to-earth characters, and grittily unromantic events.Scott wrote in an advertisement to the novel that his purpose in writing it, similar to that of his novels Waverley and Guy Mannering, was to document Scottish life and manners of a certain period, in this case the last decade of the 18th century. Scott included a glossary of Scottish terms as an appendix to the novel."

"http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Cornelius_Quartet","The Cornelius Quartet","Michael Moorcock","New Wave science fiction","Literary fiction","The Cornelius Quartet is the collective name for the Jerry Cornelius novels by Michael Moorcock, although the first one-volume edition was entitled The Cornelius Chronicles. It is composed of The Final Programme, A Cure for Cancer, The English Assassin and The Condition of Muzak. The collection has remained continuously in print for 30 years.The four novels are set in an ever shifting, yet always fashionable, alternate 'multiverse' of anarchist revolutionaries and English popart turmoil. They chart the adventures of a wide range of recurring characters, notably Jerry Cornelius and his sister Catherine, Una Persson and Colonel Pyat. The books are neither straight science fiction or pure fantasy, Moorcock himself commented 'Much of my work borrowed from the iconography and vocabulary of science fiction in the 1960s but I would not, for instance, classify the Jerry Cornelius tetralogy as a genre work'.The Complete Review said that it comprised 'an arc of Jerry Cornelius-adventures, from the (fairly) straightforward action-adventure of the first, The Final Programme, to the metaphysical summa of The Condition of Muzak.'  It observes that 'Cornelius is a superhero, but a flawed one. He is indestructible and yet has weaknesses. He is both a former Jesuit and a physicist. Party-animal and solitary soul. By the end of the tetralogy he is a messiah � yet another role he is not ideally suited for.'Reviewing the 974-page volume, Matthew Wolf-Meyer noted its influence on a host of contemporary artists in music and literature, writing that :'It would be impossible to deny the profound influences that Michael Moorcock's Jerry Cornelius novels have had, not only on the genres of science fiction and fantasy, but also popular music, film, and television. Or it might simply be that Moorcock was so perfectly in tune with the advent of postmodernism that he anticipated in his writing, in his mood, what was to come, and all the material that seems to derive from The Cornelius Quartet, in actuality, derives from the zeitgeist instead. In reading the collection, for the reader at the cusp of the 21st century, it acts as a historical piece, positing the genealogical influence of a series of more contemporary works, from Bryan Talbot's graphic novel Heart of Empire to David Bowie's album Outside; Jerry Cornelius is that common source for much of contemporary postmodern (British) popular art.'Moorcock wrote 'A note on the Jerry Cornelius Tetralogy' in 1976 in which he outlined the 'disciplined logic' which underpinned the work as a unified whole.'Part of my original intention with the Jerry Cornelius stories was to 'liberate' the narrative; to leave it open to the reader's interpretation as much as possible � to involve the reader in such a way as to bring their own imagination into play. This impulse was probably a result of my interest in Brecht � an interest I'd had since the mid-fifties.Although the structure of the tetralogy is very strict (some might think over-mechanical) the scope for interpretation is hopefully much wider than the conventional novel. The underlying logic is also very disciplined, particularly in the last three volumes. It's my view that a work of fiction should contain nothing which does not contribute to the overall scheme. The whimsicalities to be found in all the books are, in fact, not random, not mere conceits, but make internal references. That is to say, while I strive for the effect of randomness on one level, the effect is achieved by a tightly controlled system of internal reference, puns, ironies, logic-jumps which no single reader may fairly be expected to follow.'In an interview for 'The Zone' science fiction magazine, Moorcock later commented that the stories in the Cornelius saga were 'more criticism and commentary on their times than they were celebration, I knew there wasn't enough hard political infrastructure to make the sentiment come true. I said while it was happening that I knew it was a Golden Age. I sensed it couldn't last.'The collection was first published as 'The Cornelius Chronicles' in 1977 by Avon Books and a revised version under this name appeared in 1979 with an introduction by John Clute. It first appeared under the title of 'The Cornelius Quartet' in 1993 in Britain and 2001 in the United States. It was published as 'Les Aventures de Jerry Cornelius' in France. The current American edition ISBN 978-1-56858-183-5 was published by Four Walls Eight Windows in June 2001."

It was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1969, and won the French Prix Apollo in 1972. The title refers to the several paintings  by Swiss-German painter Arnold B�cklin. In the novel, Francis Sandow refers to �that mad painting by Boecklin, The Isle of the Dead.� B�cklin created at least five paintings with that title, each depicting an oarsman and a standing figure in a small boat, crossing dark water toward a forbidding island. A later Ace books edition featured a cover painting by Dean Ellis that was deliberately reminiscent of B�cklin�s work.As to the novel's inspiration, Zelazny noted, �This was a spin-off from the novelette I did called �This Moment of the Storm.� Actually, it wasn�t the guy I was interested in, at first. I wanted somebody that was born in the twentieth century, who had made it aboard one of these generation starships where he�d been frozen and spent generations getting to this new planet which proved habitable. By the time he got there, they�d invented a faster-than-light drive, because several centuries had gone by and they�d become more sophisticated. Earth had much higher technology, and he had the means of going back fast if he wanted to, but he didn�t. He wasn�t sure he was happy on the world he�d reached, though, and decided to go out and try a few others, since it was easy to do. There were still time dilation effects and, through making a few sharp investments here and there, with so much time passing, he became quite wealthy. He also happened to become the oldest human in the galaxy, and because of the fancy new medicine he was in very good shape. He also just happened to have been through the initiation ritual which would make him a god in this other religion, even though he didn�t believe in it wholeheartedly. But it was the concept of the big expanse of time that interested me.'"

He asked Ted White to collaborate on it with him, but after reviewing the manuscript White never got started. Zelazny discovered the manuscript in White's home in early 1968, read it, then contacted Dick and agreed to work on it with him. Work proceeded sporadically over several years as each author forgot about it in turn (and Zelazny's cat took the opportunity to urinate on the original manuscript). But they finished it quickly in the spring of 1975 when the publisher demanded the manuscript or repayment of the advance paid to Dick. The editor discovered Zelazny had sent photocopies of some pages and demanded the originals as per Doubleday's policy; much to Zelazny's chagrin, he had to send in the urine-stained pages and he always wondered what the editor made of them."

It was his last book, and one of his five personal favorites.The book is divided in 32 chapters, each representing one 'night' in the month of October (plus one 'introductory' chapter).  The story is told in the first-person, akin to journal entries.  Throughout, 33 full-page illustrations by Gahan Wilson (one per chapter, plus one on the inside back cover) punctuate a tale heavily influenced by H. P. Lovecraft.  The title is a line from Edgar Allan Poe's 'Ulalume' and Zelazny thanks him as well as others � Mary Shelley, Bram Stoker, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Robert Bloch and Albert Payson Terhune � whose most famous characters appear in the book.A Night in the Lonesome October was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1994.A similar theme of conflict surrounding the opening of a gate to another world exists in Zelazny's novel Madwand."

The novel was serialized in F&SF in 1971 and published in book form that same year. It was nominated for a 1972 Hugo Award and finished #4 in the 1972 Locus Poll for Best Novel.The text of the serialization and the published book are slightly different.

Following Mission's death in the narrative, the novella moves into the present day and tells of a series of deadly viruses that plague humankind, including one that causes people to believe they have the powers of Jesus Christ and another that causes uncontrollable hair growth.

Burroughs","Postmodern literature","Autobiography","Last Words: The Final Journals of William S. Burroughs is a collection of diary entries made by Beat Generation author William S. Burroughs between November 16, 1996 and July 30, 1997, only a few days before his death on August 2 at the age of 83. The collection was first published in hardcover by Grove Press in 2000 and was edited by Burroughs' longtime assistant, James Grauerholz.This final collection of writings by Burroughs was transcribed from mostly hand-written journal entries that were often difficult to decipher. Burroughs chronicles his thoughts about his approaching mortality, particularly in the wake of the death of his longtime friend Allen Ginsberg on April 5, 1997, and the passing of several beloved pets. He also expresses his feelings about political issues of the day such as the War on Drugs, and mentions being wryly amused at living in one of the cities destroyed by nuclear weapons in the TV movie The Day After (1983).His final entry describes love as 'the most natural painkiller what there is.'The book concludes with a section of annotations by Grauerholz describing events in Burroughs' life at the time of the journal entries, along with explanations for some references and people mentioned in the entries.Several of these journal entries, including his last one, were initially published in a 1998 issue of The New Yorker.Grove Press, the publishers of the book, had a long history with Burroughs dating back to the early 1960s when they published the first North American edition of Naked Lunch, sparking a landmark obscenity case."

First published in 1971 as the short story 'Ali's Smile', the book eventually contained a group of previously published newspaper articles as well, all of which address Scientology. Burroughs had been interested in Scientology throughout the 1960s, believing that its methods might help combat a controlling society. He joined the Church of Scientology later in the decade. However, he became disenchanted with the authoritarian nature of the organization. In 1970 Burroughs had published a 'considered statement' on Scientology's methods because he felt they were significant enough to warrant commentary. These pieces were later gathered together into Ali's Smile: Naked Scientology, which religious studies scholar Hugh B. Urban describes as a 'nonscholarly popular expos� of Scientology'. Burroughs's texts argue that while some of Scientology's therapies are worthwhile, the dogmatic nature of the group and its secrecy are harmful."

It is sometimes referred to as a compilation, but this is technically incorrect. Its plot cannot be easily described, although it can be said focuses upon conspiracy and the hero getting away from the police. Although the publisher John Calder claimed that it contained previously unpublished material, this extra text has never been identified.Dead Fingers Talk, like many of Burroughs' works, was controversial upon its release. It was the subject of a scathing review in the Times Literary Supplement that resulted in a war of words between supporters and detractors of the novel (and Burroughs in general) that played out in the magazine's letters page for months.The book itself is considered one of the rarer of Burroughs' novels, and despite some reprints in the 1970s, has otherwise been out of print for years."

Burroughs","Postmodern literature","Novel","Cities of the Red Night is a 1981 novel by American author William S. Burroughs, his first full-length novel since The Wild Boys (1971). It is part of his final trilogy of novels, known as The Red Night Trilogy, followed by The Place of Dead Roads (1983) and The Western Lands (1987). The plot involves a group of radical pirates who seek the freedom to live under the articles set out by Captain James Mission. In near present day, a parallel story follows a detective searching for a lost boy, abducted for use in a sexual ritual. The cities of the title mimic and parody real places, and Burroughs makes references to the United States, Mexico, and Morocco."
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Western_Lands","The Western Lands","William S. Burroughs","Postmodern literature","Novel","The Western Lands is a 1987 novel by William S. Burroughs, the final book of the trilogy that begins with Cities of the Red Night (1981) and continues with The Place of Dead Roads (1983). The title refers to the western bank of the Nile River, which in Egyptian mythology is the Land of the Dead.  Inspired by the Egyptian Book of the Dead, Burroughs explores the after-death state by means of dream scenarios, hallucinatory passages, talismanic magic, occultism, superstition, and his characteristic view of the nature of reality.The prose is notable in that it shifts back and forth between Burroughs' characters and episodes clearly drawn from his own life. Scenes that are unmistakably auto-biographical include vignettes where Burroughs takes out evidence of amphetamine prescription bottles his mother gave him to sink with a large stone at the bottom of Lake Worth, Florida. The bottles were evidence his mother found in her grandson�s, Burroughs' own son's, bedroom. While Burroughs is ankle deep in the water, his aged mother is stalling police investigators in her home. Yet the novel also dives backwards into ancient history, giving the plot a perspective on death that attempts to transcend Christian theology. Burroughs acknowledges being inspired by Norman Mailer�s Ancient Evenings, an expansive novel published in 1983 about ancient Egypt set a thousand years before Christianity. Nevertheless, there are unmistakable references to contemporary culture, for instance Mick Jagger appears in some episodes.Despite the narrative challenge of the historical framework, the novel is often regarded as Burroughs' best late work and a gratifying culminating episode of the Cities trilogy. According to The Guardian, it is his best work after Naked Lunch.  In his review for The New York Times, Jonathan Baumbach labels the novel as 'not an easy work to like' and 'offers us a vision that is viscerally unpleasant and often repellent', but yet finds the work to be a success and hold the trilogy to be 'a comic meditation on death'.  Both Baumbach and Burroughs' biographer Ted Morgan emphasize that Burroughs, in the guise of various characters, is trying to 'write his way out of death'."

The novel The Promised Land was originally published as installments in the industrial city of ?�d? by the daily Kurier Codzienny in the years 1897 � 1898.Set in ?�d?, The Promised Land tells the story of three close friends and ruthless young industrialists: a Pole, a German, and a Jew struggling to build their own factory in the heartless world of the late 19th century labor exploitation. Reymont's novel vividly paints a portrait of the rapid industrialization of ?�d? and its cruel effects on workers and mill owners. Reymont writes: 'For that 'promised land' � for that tumor � villages were deserted, forests died out, the land was depleted of its treasures, the rivers dried up, people were born.  And it sucked everything into itself.  And in its powerful jaws it crushed and chewed up people and things, sky and earth, in return giving useless millions to a handful of people, and hunger and hardship to the whole throng.'"

The translations were undertaken prior to a visit to England in 1912, where the poems were extremely well received.

Themes explored include the ubiquity of locative technology, the eversion of cyberspace and the political climate of the United States in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks. Spook Country quickly reached mainstream North American bestseller lists and was nominated for British Science Fiction Association and Locus Awards."

Set in August and September 2002, the story follows Cayce Pollard, a 32-year-old marketing consultant who has a psychological sensitivity to corporate symbols. The action takes place in London, Tokyo, and Moscow as Cayce judges the effectiveness of a proposed corporate symbol and is hired to seek the creators of film clips anonymously posted to the internet.The novel's central theme involves the examination of the human desire to detect patterns or meaning and the risks of finding patterns in meaningless data. Other themes include methods of interpretation of history, cultural familiarity with brand names, and tensions between art and commercialization. The September 11, 2001 attacks are used as a motif representing the transition to the new century. Critics identify influences in Pattern Recognition from Thomas Pynchon's postmodern detective story The Crying of Lot 49.Pattern Recognition is Gibson's eighth novel and his first one to be set in the contemporary world.  Like his previous work, it has been classified as a science fiction and postmodern novel, with the action unfolding along a thriller plot line. Critics approved of the writing but found the plot unoriginal and some of the language distracting. The book peaked at number four on the New York Times Best Seller list, was nominated for the 2003 British Science Fiction Association Award, and was shortlisted for the 2004 Arthur C. Clarke Award and Locus Awards."

The novella began as a story treatment for a proposed film adaptation of Alan E. Nourse's novel The Bladerunner. (Some sources describe Burroughs' work as a closet screenplay.)  A later edition published in the 1980s changed the formatting of the title to Blade Runner, a movie.Burroughs' treatment is set in early 21st century and involves mutated viruses and 'a medical-care apocalypse'. The term 'blade runner' referred to a smuggler of medical supplies, e.g. scalpels.No film was ever made; the title Blade Runner was later bought for use in Ridley Scott's 1982  science fiction film, Blade Runner. The plot of that film was based on Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and not the Nourse/Burroughs source material, although the film does incorporate the term 'blade runner' into dialogue."

First published in 1971 as the short story 'Ali's Smile', the book eventually contained a group of previously published newspaper articles as well, all of which address Scientology. Burroughs had been interested in Scientology throughout the 1960s, believing that its methods might help combat a controlling society. He joined the Church of Scientology later in the decade. However, he became disenchanted with the authoritarian nature of the organization. In 1970 Burroughs had published a 'considered statement' on Scientology's methods because he felt they were significant enough to warrant commentary. These pieces were later gathered together into Ali's Smile: Naked Scientology, which religious studies scholar Hugh B. Urban describes as a 'nonscholarly popular expos� of Scientology'. Burroughs's texts argue that while some of Scientology's therapies are worthwhile, the dogmatic nature of the group and its secrecy are harmful."

The vignettes (which Burroughs called 'routines') are drawn from Burroughs' own experience in these places, and his addiction to drugs (heroin, morphine, and while in Tangier, majoun (a strong marijuana confection) as well as a German opioid, brand name Eukodol, of which he wrote frequently).The novel was included in Time magazine's '100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005'.

Burroughs, the final book of the trilogy that begins with Cities of the Red Night (1981) and continues with The Place of Dead Roads (1983). The title refers to the western bank of the Nile River, which in Egyptian mythology is the Land of the Dead.  Inspired by the Egyptian Book of the Dead, Burroughs explores the after-death state by means of dream scenarios, hallucinatory passages, talismanic magic, occultism, superstition, and his characteristic view of the nature of reality.The prose is notable in that it shifts back and forth between Burroughs' characters and episodes clearly drawn from his own life. Scenes that are unmistakably auto-biographical include vignettes where Burroughs takes out evidence of amphetamine prescription bottles his mother gave him to sink with a large stone at the bottom of Lake Worth, Florida. The bottles were evidence his mother found in her grandson�s, Burroughs' own son's, bedroom. While Burroughs is ankle deep in the water, his aged mother is stalling police investigators in her home. Yet the novel also dives backwards into ancient history, giving the plot a perspective on death that attempts to transcend Christian theology. Burroughs acknowledges being inspired by Norman Mailer�s Ancient Evenings, an expansive novel published in 1983 about ancient Egypt set a thousand years before Christianity. Nevertheless, there are unmistakable references to contemporary culture, for instance Mick Jagger appears in some episodes.Despite the narrative challenge of the historical framework, the novel is often regarded as Burroughs' best late work and a gratifying culminating episode of the Cities trilogy. According to The Guardian, it is his best work after Naked Lunch.  In his review for The New York Times, Jonathan Baumbach labels the novel as 'not an easy work to like' and 'offers us a vision that is viscerally unpleasant and often repellent', but yet finds the work to be a success and hold the trilogy to be 'a comic meditation on death'.  Both Baumbach and Burroughs' biographer Ted Morgan emphasize that Burroughs, in the guise of various characters, is trying to 'write his way out of death'."

Spanish Yo el supremo) is a historical novel written by exiled Paraguayan author Augusto Roa Bastos. It is a fictionalized account of the nineteenth-century Paraguayan dictator Jos� Gaspar Rodr�guez de Francia, who was also known as 'Dr. Francia.'  The book's title derives from the fact that Francia referred to himself as 'El Supremo' or 'the Supreme.' The first in a long line of dictators, the Supreme was a severe, calculating despot.  The central themes of the novel are power and language and the relation between the two.  The Supreme believes himself to be above all power and history:  'I don't write history. I make it. I can remake it as I please, adjusting, stressing, enriching its meaning and truth.' Yet this assertion is constantly challenged by the very fact that while he achieves power by means of writing and dictating, these very same methods can be used by others to dispute his authority. Not even his own identity, represented by the personal pronoun I, is safe and can easily be usurped as is demonstrated by the incident of the pasquinade. Language, as powerful as it is, can never be controlled and can just as easily be used as an instrument of coercion as an instrument of resistance.During the time the book was written, Paraguay was under the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who went on to rule the country even longer than Francia did. Many consider the book to be at least in part a thinly disguised attack on Stroessner who used methods similar to Francia�s to achieve and maintain the effective control of the country, including the swift elimination of opposition, the employment of torture and intolerance of dissent. In its portrayal of Francia and criticism of Stroessner, I, the Supreme belongs to the genre of novelas de dictadores or dictator novels, and also to the Latin American Boom, a literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s. The book was first published in Spanish in 1974, and in English (translation by Helen Lane) in 1986.Like many other works of the Latin American boom, the book never became an international best-seller. It was, however, highly regarded by critics with Gerald Martin claiming that it was, 'an exceptional cultural phenomenon.' Martin goes on to suggest that it was 'more immediately and unanimously acclaimed than any novel since One Hundred Years of Solitude, [and its] strictly historical importance [may] be even greater than that of Garc�a M�rquez's fabulously successful creation.' The book's handling of the themes of power and language was also praised. Still, the novel was not well received by Stroessner�s government and Roa Bastos became 'one of the three citizens forbidden to return' to Paraguay as a result."

The central themes of the novel are power and language and the relation between the two.  The Supreme believes himself to be above all power and history:  'I don't write history. I make it. I can remake it as I please, adjusting, stressing, enriching its meaning and truth.' Yet this assertion is constantly challenged by the very fact that while he achieves power by means of writing and dictating, these very same methods can be used by others to dispute his authority. Not even his own identity, represented by the personal pronoun I, is safe and can easily be usurped as is demonstrated by the incident of the pasquinade. Language, as powerful as it is, can never be controlled and can just as easily be used as an instrument of coercion as an instrument of resistance.During the time the book was written, Paraguay was under the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who went on to rule the country even longer than Francia did. Many consider the book to be at least in part a thinly disguised attack on Stroessner who used methods similar to Francia�s to achieve and maintain the effective control of the country, including the swift elimination of opposition, the employment of torture and intolerance of dissent. In its portrayal of Francia and criticism of Stroessner, I, the Supreme belongs to the genre of novelas de dictadores or dictator novels, and also to the Latin American Boom, a literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s. The book was first published in Spanish in 1974, and in English (translation by Helen Lane) in 1986.Like many other works of the Latin American boom, the book never became an international best-seller. It was, however, highly regarded by critics with Gerald Martin claiming that it was, 'an exceptional cultural phenomenon.' Martin goes on to suggest that it was 'more immediately and unanimously acclaimed than any novel since One Hundred Years of Solitude, [and its] strictly historical importance [may] be even greater than that of Garc�a M�rquez's fabulously successful creation.' The book's handling of the themes of power and language was also praised. Still, the novel was not well received by Stroessner�s government and Roa Bastos became 'one of the three citizens forbidden to return' to Paraguay as a result."

Most of the chapters were written during this trip.The phrase 'Trout Fishing in America' is used in various ways: it is the title of the book, a character, a hotel, the act of fishing itself, a modifier (one character is named 'Trout Fishing in America Shorty'), etc.  Brautigan uses the theme of trout fishing as a point of departure for thinly veiled and often comical critiques of mainstream American society and culture.  Several symbolic objects, such as a mayonnaise jar, a Ben Franklin statue in San Francisco's Washington Square, trout, etc. reappear throughout the book.The cover of the book is a photograph of Richard Brautigan and a friend identified as Michaela Le Grand, whom he referred to as his 'Muse.' The photo was taken in San Francisco's Washington Square Park in front of the Benjamin Franklin statue.  The first chapter of the book is an extended and fanciful description of this photo.Arion Press published a deluxe edition of Trout Fishing in America in 2003, with a preface by Ron Loewinsohn, and a color lithograph in half the edition by Wayne Thiebaud."

The pair also develop a system called 'checking' which they use to tap into true wants and likes, as the only means of differentiating these from stored or learned responses.The book relates Williams' diagnosis with scotopic sensitivity syndrome, and her experience with tinted lenses on her visual perceptual disorders including visual fragmentation, context blindness, face blindness, and loss of depth perception. This led to a wide social awakening to visual perceptual disorders in people on the autistic spectrum.Williams also writes about facilitated communication, covering the story of 'Alex' and quoting his first letters, as he develops communication for the first time through assisted typing, enabling his movement from special education towards a future as a college graduate."

Lawrence, Vincent van Gogh, Vaslav Nijinsky, George Bernard Shaw, William Blake, Friedrich Nietzsche, Fyodor Dostoevsky and G. I. Gurdjieff � Wilson explores the psyche of the Outsider, his effect on society, and society's effect on him.On Christmas Day, 1954, alone in his room, Wilson sat down on his bed and began to write in his journal. He described his feelings as follows:'It struck me that I was in the position of so many of my favourite characters in fiction: Dostoevsky's Raskolnikov, Rilke's Malte Laurids Brigge, the young writer in Hamsun's Hunger: alone in my room, feeling totally cut off from the rest of society. It was not a position I relished...Yet an inner compulsion had forced me into this position of isolation. I began writing about it in my journal, trying to pin it down. And then, quite suddenly, I saw that I had the makings of a book. I turned to the back of my journal and wrote at the head of the page: 'Notes for a book The Outsider in Literature'...' And so The Outsider was conceived - a book that has, to date, been translated into over thirty languages (including Russian and Chinese) and never been out of print since publication day: Monday, May 28, 1956. Wilson wrote much of it in the Reading Room of the British Museum, and during this period was, for a time, living in a sleeping bag on Hampstead Heath. He continued to work on it at a furious pace and:'One day I typed out the introduction, and a few pages from the middle, and sent them to Victor Gollancz with a letter giving a synopsis of the book. He replied within 2 days, saying he would be interested to see the book when completed ...' He was inspired to send the book to Victor Gollancz of  publishers Victor Gollancz Ltd after he found a copy of the publisher's own book A Year of Grace in a second-hand bookshop, which led him to believe that he had found a sympathetic publisher."

This is Wilson's fifty-first book. It is about the remnants of a race of intergalactic vampires who are brought back from outer space and are inadvertently let loose on Earth.The titular space aliens are energy vampires, as opposed to the familiar stereotypical blood-sucking Earth vampires that suck blood and change into bats. They consume the 'life force' by seducing living beings with a deadly kiss and also have the ability to take control of the willing host bodies of their victims. Though initially the aliens' 'true' form appears to be a bat-like creature, the creatures are ultimately revealed to be insubstantial energy-beings from a higher dimension. The novel's protagonist is Captain Olof Carlsen, the commanding officer of the space exploration vehicle which discovered the vampires' spacecraft.The novel was mildly successful and was translated into many languages including Spanish, Japanese, French, Italian, Dutch and Swedish.The concept and set-up of the novel was apparently inspired by, and loosely based on, the purported phenomenon and mythologic legend of psychic vampirism."

"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tarr","Tarr","Wyndham Lewis","Vorticism","Modernism","Tarr is a modernist novel by Wyndham Lewis, written in 1909�11, revised and expanded in 1914�15 and first serialized in the magazine The Egoist from April 1916 until November 1917. The American version was published in 1918, with an English edition published by the Egoist Press appearing shortly afterwards; Lewis later created a revised and final version published by Chatto and Windus in 1928. Set in the bohemian milieu of pre-war Paris, it presents two artists, the Englishman Tarr and the German Kreisler, and their struggles with money, women, and social situations. The novel abounds in somewhat Nietzschean themes. Tarr, generally thought to be modelled on Lewis himself, displays disdain for the 'bourgeois-bohemians' around him, and vows to 'throw off humour' which he regards�especially in its English form�as a 'means of evading reality' unsuited to ambition and the modern world. This self-conscious attitude and the situations that it brings about are, ironically, a major source of the novel's pervasive dark humour. Kreisler, a violent German Romantic of protean energy and a failure as an artist, is in many ways the focus of the novel. An indication of the extremity of his vivid portrait is Lewis's own wondering several years later if he had, in Kreisler, anticipated the personality of Hitler.The American first edition used a punctuation mark (resembling an equals sign: '=') between sentences (after full stops, exclamation marks or question marks; in the earlier Egoist version it had been an m-dash). It has been claimed that these were an attempt by Lewis, an artist, to introduce 'painterly strokes' into literature. This has, however, been disputed by Dr. John Constable, who believes that they are nothing more than a German punctuation mark briefly adopted by Lewis. Lewis himself wrote to Ezra Pound about this when reconstructing missing parts of the manuscript for the U.S. edition: 'Were those parallel lines = Quinn mentions kept going by the Egoist, or not? Could not they be disinterred, & used by Knopf?' (Lewis to Pound, October 1917). Evidently not all were disinterred, as large stretches of the book as published are without them. Both the 1918 and 1928 versions of the novel have been in and out of print since its original publication. Oxford University Press has reissued the 1928 text, edited and with notes by Scott W. Klein of Wake Forest University, as part of its Oxford World Classics paperback series in 2010."

"http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Egyptian","The Egyptian","Mika Waltari","Tulenkantajat","Historical fiction","The Egyptian (Sinuhe egyptil�inen, Sinuhe the Egyptian) is a historical novel by Mika Waltari. It was first published in Finnish in 1945, and in an abridged English translation by Naomi Walford in 1949, apparently from Swedish rather than Finnish. So far, it is the only Finnish novel to be adapted into a Hollywood film, which it was, in 1954.The Egyptian is the first and the most successful, of Waltari's great historical novels. It is set in Ancient Egypt, mostly during the reign of Pharaoh Akhenaten of the 18th Dynasty, whom some have claimed to be the first monotheistic ruler in the world.The protagonist of the novel is the fictional character Sinuhe, the royal physician, who tells the story in exile after Akhenaten's fall and death. Apart from incidents in Egypt, the novel charts Sinuhe's travels in then Egyptian-dominated Syria (Levant), in Mitanni, Babylon, Minoan Crete, and among the Hittites.The main character of the novel is named after a character in an ancient Egyptian text commonly known as The Story of Sinuhe. The original story dates to a time long before that of Akhenaten: texts are known from as early as the 12th dynasty.Supporting historical characters include the old Pharaoh Amenhotep III and his conniving favorite wife, Tiy; the wife of Akhenaten, Nefertiti; the listless young Tutankhamun (King Tut), who succeeded as Pharaoh after Akhenaten's downfall; and the two common-born successors who were, according to this author, integral parts of the rise and fall of the Amarna heresy of Akhenaten: the priest and later Pharaoh Ay and the warrior-general and then finally Pharaoh, Horemheb. Though never appearing onstage, throughout the book the Hittite King Suppiluliuma I appears as a brooding threatening figure of a completely ruthless conqueror and tyrannical ruler.Other historical figures, the protagonist has direct dealings with, are: Aziru (ruler of Amurru kingdom), Thutmose (sculptor), Burna-Buriash II (Babylonian king), and, under a different name, Zannanza, son of Suppiluliuma I. Zannanza's bride is a collage of at least three historical figures: herself, first wife of Horemheb and, by him, mother of Ramesses I. Historical Horemheb died childless.Although Waltari employed some poetic license in combining the biographies of Sinuhe and Akhenaten, he was otherwise much concerned about the historical accuracy of his detailed description of ancient Egyptian life and carried out considerable research into the subject. The result has been praised not only by readers but also by Egyptologists.Waltari had long been interested in Akhenaten and wrote a play about him which was staged in Helsinki in 1938. World War II provided the final impulse for exploring the subject in a novel which, although depicting events that took place over 3,300 years ago, in fact reflects the contemporary feelings of disillusionment and war-weariness and carries a pessimistic message of the essential sameness of human nature throughout the ages. The threatening King Suppiluliuma has many of the overtones of Hitler.Such a message evoked a wide response in readers in the aftermath of the World War, and the book became an international bestseller, topping the bestseller lists in the USA in 1949. It remained the most sold foreign novel in the US before its place was taken over by The Name of the Rose, by Umberto Eco. The Egyptian has been translated into 40 languages."

It was written in response to the Poet Laureate Robert Southey's A Vision of Judgement (1821), which had imagined the soul of king George triumphantly entering Heaven to receive his due.  Byron was provoked by the High Tory point of view from which the poem was written, and he took personally Southey's preface which had attacked those 'Men of diseased hearts and depraved imaginations' who had set up a 'Satanic school' of poetry, 'characterized by a Satanic spirit of pride and audacious impiety'.  He responded in the preface to his own Vision of Judgment with an attack on 'The gross flattery, the dull impudence, the renegado intolerance, and impious cant, of the poem', and mischievously referred to Southey as 'the author of Wat Tyler', an anti-royalist work from Southey's firebrand revolutionary youth.  His parody of A Vision of Judgement was so lastingly successful that, as the critic Geoffrey Carnall wrote, 'Southey's reputation has never recovered from Byron's ridicule.'"

It is about the journey of Momaday's Kiowa ancestors from their ancient beginnings in the Montana area to their final war and surrender to the United States Cavalry at Fort Sill, and subsequent resettlement near Rainy Mountain, Oklahoma.The Way to Rainy Mountain by N. Scott Momaday, a unique blend of history, folklore, and poetic memoir, was published in 1969. It takes the reader through author N. Scott Momaday�s own journey of discovering his Kiowa background and identity. The journey is told in three separate voices: The first voice, the ancestral voice, tells about the Kiowa by using oral traditions and myths; the second voice is a historical commentary; and finally, the third voice is Momaday�s poetic memoir of his experiences. All three voices together teach about the Kiowa�s origin, beliefs, traditions, morals, and conflicts. Not only does the journey recounted in this book help Momaday better understand his ancestry, it also teaches about the Kiowa tribe�s history. The uniqueness of this text, however, has been an issue for some readers; they claim it is confusing to follow and discombobulating. Others find it easier to understand by reading each individual voice consecutively instead of alternating from one voice to another as the book is written. The Way to Rainy Mountain continues to be an entry point to Kiowa history and a way to open discussions about what constitutes any history of a people."
